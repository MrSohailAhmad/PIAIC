Advanced economies will experience the benefits and pitfalls of AI sooner than emerging \\nmarket and developing economies, largely because their employment structure is focused on cognitive-\\nintensive roles. There are some consistent patterns concerning AI exposure: women and college-educated \\nindividuals are more exposed but also better poised to reap AI benefits, and older workers are potentially less \\nable to adapt to the new technology. Labor income inequality may increase if the complementarity between AI \\nand high-income workers is strong, and capital returns will increase wealth inequality. However, if productivity \\ngains are sufficiently large, income levels could surge for most workers. In this evolving landscape, advanced \\neconomies and more developed emerging market economies need to focus on upgrading regulatory \\nframeworks and supporting labor reallocation while safeguarding those adversely affected. Emerging market \\nand developing economies should prioritize the development of digital infrastructure and digital skills.  \\n \\nRECOMMENDED CITATION: Cazzaniga and others. 2024. “Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and  the Future of \\nWork.” IMF Staff Discussion Note SDN2024/001, International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC.  \\nISBN: 979-8-40026-254-8  \\nJEL Classification Numbers:  E24, J24, J31, O33, O38 \\nKeywords: \\nArtificial Intelligence, Labor Market, Job Displacement, Income \\nInequality, Advanced Economies, Emerging Market Economies, Low-\\nIncome Developing Countries \\nAuthor’s E-Mail Address:  \\nmauro98cazzaniga@gmail.com, FJaumotte@imf.org, LLi4@imf.org, \\nGMelina@imf.org, APanton@imf.org, CPizzinelli@imf.org, \\nERockall@stanford.edu, MMendestavares@imf.org    \\n    \\n* The authors thank Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas and Antonio Spilimbergo for feedback and guidance and many IMF colleagues for \\nuseful comments.

Its consequences for economies and societies remain hard \\nto foresee. This is especially evident in the context of labor markets, where AI promises to increase productivity \\nwhile threatening to replace humans in some jobs and to complement them in others. \\n \\nAlmost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to AI, with advanced economies at greater risk but \\nalso better poised to exploit AI benefits than emerging market and developing economies. In advanced \\neconomies, about 60 percent of jobs are exposed to AI, due to prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. A \\nnew measure of potential AI complementarity suggests that, of these, about half may be negatively affected by \\nAI, while the rest could benefit from enhanced productivity through AI integration. Overall exposure is 40 \\npercent in emerging market economies and 26 percent in low-income countries. Although many emerging \\nmarket and developing economies may experience less immediate AI-related disruptions, they are also less \\nready to seize AI’s advantages. This could exacerbate the digital divide and cross-country income disparity.  \\n \\nAI will affect income and wealth inequality. Unlike previous waves of automation, which had the strongest \\neffect on middle-skilled workers, AI displacement risks extend to higher-wage earners. However, potential AI \\ncomplementarity is positively correlated with income. Hence, the effect on labor income inequality depends \\nlargely on the extent to which AI displaces or complements high-income workers. Model simulations suggest \\nthat, with high complementarity, higher-wage earners can expect a more-than-proportional increase in their \\nlabor income, leading to an increase in labor income inequality. This would amplify the increase in income and \\nwealth inequality that results from enhanced capital returns that accrue to high earners. Countries’ choices \\nregarding the definition of AI property rights, as well as redistributive and other fiscal policies, will ultimately \\nshape its impact on income and wealth distribution.  \\n \\nThe gains in productivity, if strong, could result in higher growth and higher incomes for most workers. \\nOwing to capital deepening and a productivity surge, AI adoption is expected to boost total income. If AI \\nstrongly complements human labor in certain occupations and the productivity gains are sufficiently large, \\nhigher growth and labor demand could more than compensate for the partial replacement of labor tasks by AI, \\nand incomes could increase along most of the income distribution.    \\n \\nCollege-educated workers are better prepared to move from jobs at risk of displacement to high-\\ncomplementarity jobs; older workers may be more vulnerable to the AI-driven transformation. In the UK \\nand Brazil, for instance, college-educated individuals historically moved more easily from jobs now assessed to \\nhave high displacement potential to those with high complementarity. In contrast, workers without \\npostsecondary education show reduced mobility. Younger workers who are adaptable and familiar with new \\ntechnologies may also be better able to leverage the new opportunities. In contrast, older workers may struggle \\nwith reemployment, adapting to technology, mobility, and training for new job skills. \\n \\nTo harness AI's potential fully, priorities depend on countries’ development levels.

Introduction \\nArtificial intelligence (AI) promises to boost productivity and growth, but its impact on economies and \\nsocieties is uncertain, varying by job roles and sectors, with the potential to amplify disparities. As a \\npositive productivity shock, AI will expand economies’ production frontiers and will lead to reallocations \\nbetween labor and capital while triggering potentially profound changes in many jobs and sectors. AI offers \\nunprecedented opportunities for solving complex problems and improving the accuracy of predictions, \\nenhancing decision-making, boosting economic growth, and improving lives. However, precisely because of its \\nvast and flexible applicability in numerous domains, the implications for economies and societies are uncertain \\n(Ilzetzki and Jain 2023). \\n \\nAI represents a wide spectrum of technologies designed to enable machines to perceive, interpret, act, \\nand learn with the intent to emulate human cognitive abilities. Across this spectrum, generative AI (GenAI) \\nincludes systems such as sophisticated large language models that can create new content, ranging from text \\nto images, by learning from extensive training data. Other AI models, in contrast, are more specialized, \\nfocusing on discrete tasks such as pattern identification. Meanwhile, automation is characterized by its focus on \\noptimizing repetitive tasks to boost productivity, rather than producing new content. The field of AI is \\nexperiencing a swift evolution, especially with the advent of GenAI, which has broadened AI's potential \\napplications. This suggests that its impact will expand to reshape job functions and the division of labor. \\n \\nOne critical dimension to consider is the societal acceptability of AI. Acceptability may vary depending on \\njob roles. Some professions may seamlessly integrate AI tools, while others could face resistance because of \\ncultural, ethical, or operational concerns. This uncertainty becomes especially pronounced in labor markets. \\nAlthough AI holds the potential for production-oriented applications, its effect will likely be mixed. In some \\nsectors where human oversight of AI is necessary, it could amplify worker productivity and labor demand. \\nConversely, in other sectors, AI might pave the way for significant job displacements. A rise in aggregate \\nproductivity of the economy could however strengthen overall economic demand, potentially creating more job \\nopportunities for most workers in a ripple effect. Moreover, this evolution could also lead to the emergence of \\nnew sectors and job roles—and the disappearance of others—transcending mere intersectoral reallocation. \\n \\nBeyond immediate job effects, another critical economic dimension is the capital income channel. As AI \\ndrives efficiency and innovations, those who own AI technologies or have stakes in AI-driven industries may \\nexperience increased capital income. This shift could potentially exacerbate inequalities. \\n \\nAI challenges the belief that technology affects mainly middle and, in some cases, low-skill jobs: its \\nadvanced algorithms can now augment or replace high-skill roles previously thought immune to \\nautomation. While historical waves of automation and the integration of information technology affected \\npredominantly routine tasks, AI's capabilities extend to cognitive functions, enabling it to process vast amounts \\nof data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. As a result, even high-skill occupations, which were \\npreviously considered immune to automation because of their complexity and reliance on deep expertise now \\nface potential disruption.1 Jobs that require nuanced judgment, creative problem-solving, or intricate data \\n    \\n1 Another historical example of technology that hit the relatively educated is the introduction of the calculator.

Before the widespread \\nuse of calculators, the role of accountants was considered a medium- to high-skill job, given that a significant portion of the \\npopulation was uneducated.

This \\nshift challenges the conventional wisdom that technological advances threaten primarily lower-skill jobs and \\npoints to a broader and deeper transformation of the labor market than by previous technological revolutions. \\n \\nThe impact of AI is also likely to differ significantly across countries at different levels of development \\nor with different economic structures. Advanced economies, with their mature industries and service-driven \\neconomies, typically have a higher concentration of jobs in sectors that require complex cognitive tasks. These \\neconomies are therefore both more susceptible to, yet better positioned to benefit from, AI innovations. \\nConversely, emerging market and developing economies, often still reliant on manual labor and traditional \\nindustries, may initially face fewer AI-induced disruptions. However, these economies may also miss out on \\nearly AI-driven productivity gains, given their lack of infrastructure and a skilled workforce. Over time, the AI \\ndivide could exacerbate existing economic disparities, with advanced economies harnessing AI for competitive \\nadvantage while emerging market and developing economies grapple with integrating AI into their growth \\nmodels. \\n \\nTo inform the discussion on the potential impact of AI on the future of work and which policies \\ncountries should enact in response, this note aims to answer six questions. \\n \\n(1) Which countries are more exposed to AI adoption? Which countries are likely to benefit most? \\n(2) How differently will AI affect workers within countries? Which segments of workers are likely to thrive \\nand which face more risks?  \\n(3) Historically, how frequently did workers shift between roles now facing varying AI exposure? What \\ninsights do these shifts reveal about labor adaptability? \\n(4) In what ways could AI reshape income and wealth inequality?  \\n(5) What is the potential impact for growth and productivity?  \\n(6) Which countries appear better prepared for the AI transition? How can policies maximize gains and \\nmitigate likely AI-related challenges? \\n \\nThis note builds on a growing body of work that explores the impact of AI on labor markets and the \\nmacroeconomy. Many empirical studies so far have focused largely on the US, finding that many of the tasks \\nof a significant portion of the workforce, including those of high-skilled workers, could be substantially replaced \\nby AI (for example, Felten, Raj, and Seamans 2021, 2023; Eloundou and others 2023; Webb 2020). A few \\nstudies (OECD 2023; Albanesi and others 2023; Briggs and Kodnani 2023) adopt a cross-country approach; \\nGmyrek, Berg, and Bescond (2023) undertake a comprehensive review of emerging market economies and \\nfind less exposure to AI than in advanced economies; Colombo, Mercorio, and Mezzanzanica (2019) focus on \\nthe Italian labor market. These studies apply empirical approaches similar to those used in the automation \\nliterature (for example, Autor and Dorn 2013, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2022, Das and Hilgenstock 2022).  \\n \\nThis note contributes to the existing literature in four significant ways. First, while previous AI exposure \\nmeasures often implicitly equate exposure with substitutability of human tasks, this note attempts to assess the \\npotential for complementarity and substitution with labor, using the approach developed by Pizzinelli and others \\n(2023). This method considers the wider social, ethical, and physical context of occupations, along with \\nrequired skill levels, to discern whether AI may complement or replace roles. This adds to recent studies that \\nhave attempted to make this distinction using a purely task-based framework (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018,'),\n",

Third, it takes a deep \\nlook at how AI may affect income and wealth inequality within countries. It dissects AI exposure patterns across \\ndemographics and earnings levels and uses a model-based analysis to evaluate AI's impact on labor and \\ncapital income inequality, as well as on income levels. Last, the note examines how AI preparedness for this \\ntechnological shift may differ across countries at different income levels, using a very large sample of advanced \\nand emerging market and developing economies.  \\n \\nWith this analysis there are some important caveats. First, although in the model analysis activity grows in \\noccupations with high AI complementarity and falls in low-complementarity occupations—mimicking sectoral \\nreallocations—the analysis on AI exposure assumes that sector sizes are fixed and that the tasks required in \\neach occupation are unchanged. Consequently, the results are more pertinent for the short to medium term. \\nOver longer horizons, workers will likely migrate across different sectors and roles, or acquire new skills, and \\njobs will evolve. In addition, the analysis assumes that workers within the same occupation will be affected in \\nthe same way, but there can be variation in the effects of AI. AI may also affect firm dynamics and market \\nconcentration (Babina and others, forthcoming), driving inequality between workers at different firms. Second, \\nthe study relies on the premise that tasks performed within similar occupations are homogenous around the \\nworld, while there can be significant cross-country variations. Third, the approach abstracts from linkages \\nacross occupations and countries (trade linkages), as well as from cross-border spillovers of AI exposure. Last, \\nwhile the analyses on workers’ AI exposure and societies’ preparedness use empirical approaches, the \\npotential impacts on inequality and productivity are analyzed with a model. The latter therefore depend on \\npotentially strong calibration assumptions. The pace of AI adoption, influenced by the time needed by firms to \\ninvest in any necessary physical capital and the reorganization required to capitalize on AI, is difficult to \\nforesee. Likewise, the time required to exert aggregate macroeconomic effects, the impact on intersectoral \\nreallocation of factors for production, the birth of new industries, and AI’s exact implications for economies and \\nsocieties are challenging to predict. Any estimate embodies a level of uncertainty reminiscent of past \\nintroductions of general-purpose technologies, such as electricity. This uncertainty applies also to the results of \\nthis note. \\n \\nThe remainder of the note is structured as follows. Section II illustrates the conceptual framework of AI \\nexposure and complementarity and attempts to quantify empirically the degree of exposure to and \\ncomplementarity with AI across countries and groups of workers within countries. Section III examines how \\neasily workers have historically shifted across roles now facing varying degrees of AI exposure and \\ncomplementarity. Section IV uses a model to project potential implications of AI adoption for productivity, \\nincomes, and inequality. Section V assesses countries’ AI preparedness in key policy areas. Section VI \\nconcludes and presents policy considerations.   \\n \\nII. AI Exposure and Complementarity  \\nII.1 Conceptual Framework \\n \\nAssessing the impact of AI on employment is complex because of its swift evolution, uncertainty in \\nintegration across production processes, and shifting societal perceptions.

Over time, the changing social acceptability of AI could \\nalso affect its integration into production processes. \\n \\nThis note refines a commonly used conceptual framework to better measure human work’s exposure \\nto, and complementarity with, AI. To study the effect of technological innovation on jobs, it is standard to \\nconceptualize individual occupations as a bundle of tasks and to consider which tasks can be replaced or \\ncomplemented by technology (see for instance Acemoglu and Restrepo 2022; and Moll, Rachel, and Restrepo \\n2022 for recent applications). Felten, Raj, and Seamans (2021, 2023) define “exposure” to AI as the degree of \\noverlap between AI applications and required human abilities in each occupation. The analysis refines this \\napproach by augmenting it with Pizzinelli and others’ (2023) index of potential AI complementarity. This index \\nleverages information on the social, ethical, and physical context of occupations, along with required skill levels \\n(see Box 1 for details). The index reflects an occupation’s likely degree of shielding from AI-driven job \\ndisplacement and, when paired with high AI exposure, gives an indication of AI complementarity potential. For \\nexample, because of advances in textual analysis, judges are highly exposed to AI, but they are also highly \\nshielded from displacement because society is currently unlikely to delegate judicial rulings to unsupervised AI. \\nConsequently, AI will likely complement judges, increasing their productivity rather than replacing them.2 \\nConversely, clerical workers, who are also very exposed to AI but have a lower level of shielding, are more at \\nrisk of being displaced. The level of shielding and complementarity will likely evolve over time and at a different \\npace across countries, reflecting higher AI accuracy, which will decrease the chances for “hallucinations”—AI \\nsystem output that is not based on reality or a given context. Social preferences and available alternatives will \\nalso play a role (see Pizzinelli and others 2023 for quantitative illustrations of this phenomenon). For example, \\nin low-income countries, where trained doctors are scarce, scalable AI-backed medical consultations may be \\nviewed as an attractive option. The remainder of this note refers to the complementarity potential driven by high \\nAI exposure and high shielding more succinctly as “complementarity.” \\n \\nJoint consideration of exposure and complementarity indicates the types of labor market \\ndevelopments each occupation is more likely to experience with AI adoption. Occupations with high \\nexposure for which AI can autonomously complete tasks may see reduced human labor demand, leading to \\nlower wages. Jobs that require human supervision over AI may experience a boost in productivity, which would \\nraise labor demand and wages for incumbent workers. However, even in occupations in which AI is likely to \\ncomplement human labor, workers without AI-related skills risk reduced employment. Hence, the ease of \\nacquiring AI-related skills will determine the ultimate impact of this technology.   \\n \\nBased on these two criteria, occupations can be categorized into three groups: “high exposure, high \\ncomplementarity”; “high exposure, low complementarity”; and “low exposure” (see Box 1).3 Although \\nthe indicators (and the thresholds adopted to define what is high and low, represented by their median values) \\nare relative measures, this categorization highlights the overarching differences across occupations in terms of \\ntheir AI exposure and complementarity potential. High-exposure, high-complementarity occupations have \\nsignificant potential for AI support, as AI can complement workers in their tasks and decision-making. However,'),\n",

In such roles, workers can potentially reap the productivity benefits from AI, provided they have the \\nskills needed to interact with the technology. On the other hand, high-exposure, low-complementarity \\noccupations are well positioned for AI integration, but there is a greater likelihood that AI will replace human \\ntasks. This could lead to a decline in labor demand and slower wage growth for these jobs. Telemarketers are \\na prime example. Last, low-exposure occupations” have minimal or no potential for AI application. This group \\nencompasses a diverse range of professions, from dishwashers and performers to others. \\n \\nThis conceptual framework is subject to several caveats. First, the index of Felten, Raj, and Seamans \\n(2021) and the complementarity measure discussed in Box 1 offer only a relative interpretation. In other words, \\nthese measures tell us whether a given occupation is more or less exposed, or complementary, than others. \\nSecond, high complementarity can still result in displacement from occupations of workers who do not have the \\nrequired skills or whose employers do not invest in the technology. Companies investing in these technologies \\nearlier would solidify commercial advantages over competitors. In other words, while the analysis assumes that \\nworkers within the same occupation will be affected in the same way, there can be variation in the effects of AI. \\nFirms that are more successful at integrating AI may increase their productivity more than competitors and pay \\nhigher wages, exacerbating intra-occupational inequality. Third, the conceptual framework provides only a \\nstatic view of exposure and complementarity. In this regard, it does not speak to the existing or prospective \\navailability of necessary IT infrastructure or to workers’ ability to acquire the needed skills or to relocate across \\ndifferent occupations. Neither does it take into account the effects of ongoing integration of AI and robotics. In \\naddition, it does not factor in potential changes in societal preferences, which will also shape regulations and \\ncould make unsupervised AI acceptable in a growing number of contexts or ban its use in others. On the \\nmacroeconomic side, it does not account for adoption speed and the factors influencing adoption, including \\ncosts borne by firms compared with productivity benefits. The conceptual framework also does not factor in \\nfeedback effects, which, for example—through higher overall productivity as a result of AI adoption—could \\nboost labor demand for most types of jobs, partially offsetting potential negative impacts of AI.  \\n \\nThe note applies this categorization to appraise the exposure of the current employment structure to AI \\nfor a large number of countries. The definitions are applied to 142 countries using the online International \\nLabour Organization (ILO) employment database and an internationally consistent classification of occupations. \\nTo examine within-country variation, a more granular level of the categorization—based on more than 400 \\noccupation titles—is also applied to countries with good microdata coverage: two advanced economies (UK \\nand US) and four emerging market economies (Brazil, Colombia, India, South Africa).4  \\nII.2 Cross-Country Differences \\n \\nAbout 40 percent of workers worldwide are in high-exposure occupations; the share is 60 percent in \\nadvanced economies, which indicates potentially large macroeconomic implications.

Almost 70 and 60 percent of UK and US employment, respectively, is in high-exposure occupations, \\napproximately equally distributed between those that are high- and low-complementarity positions. High-\\nexposure employment in emerging market economies ranges from 41 percent in Brazil to 26 percent in India. \\n \\nFigure 1.

Share of employment within each country group is calculated as the \\nworking-age-population-weighted average. \\n \\nThe composition of the labor force in terms of broad occupational groups reflecting countries’ \\neconomic structure explains most of the differences in exposure and complementarity across \\ncountries. Figure 2 reports the employment shares by occupational groups for three countries with markedly \\ndifferent shares of employment in exposed occupations. The UK has a significant portion of employment in \\nprofessional and managerial occupations, which exhibit high exposure and high complementarity, and in \\nclerical support workers and technician occupations, generally high exposure and low complementarity.

Given their high shares of employment in both low- and high-complementarity occupations, \\nadvanced economies may experience a more polarized effect from the structural transformation brought about \\nby AI. On one hand, they face a greater risk of labor displacement and harmful income developments for \\nworkers in the high-exposure and low-complementarity occupations. On the other hand, they are better \\npositioned to take advantage early of the emerging AI growth opportunities as a result of their larger amount of \\nemployment in high-exposure and high-complementarity jobs. The net employment impact will depend on \\ncountries’ ability to innovate, adopt, and adapt to AI. Both advanced and emerging market and developing \\neconomies are subject to considerable uncertainty surrounding these predictions. For example, in low-income \\ncountries AI adoption could mirror the swift adoption of mobile technology and lead to large marginal benefits \\nfrom AI. In addition, with the appropriate digital infrastructure in place, AI may also represent an opportunity for \\nemerging market and developing economies to address skill shortages, especially in the health and education \\nsectors, potentially increasing inclusion and productivity (Box 2). \\nII.3 Within-Country Differences \\n \\nBeyond the overall exposure of each country to AI, different groups within countries are likely to be \\naffected differently. The advent of AI could exacerbate inequality within countries along various dimensions, \\nsuch as the income level of individuals, their education level, or their gender. Understanding which groups are \\nmost vulnerable is essential to design policies that can mitigate those effects. Interestingly, while the overall \\nexposure of countries to AI differs significantly between advanced and emerging market and developing \\neconomies, the patterns of exposure across individuals within countries are very similar for the two advanced \\neconomies and the four emerging market economies included in the granular microdata analysis. An important \\ncaveat is that findings may be different in other countries.  \\n \\nExposure is higher for women and for more educated workers but is mitigated by a higher potential for \\ncomplementarity with AI (Figure 3). In most countries, women tend to be employed in high-exposure \\noccupations more than men (Figure 3, panel 1). Because this share is distributed approximately equally'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/SDNEA2024001.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='STAFF DISCUSSION NOTES Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work \\n \\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 10 \\n \\nbetween low- and high-complementarity jobs, the result can be interpreted to mean that women face both \\ngreater risks and greater opportunities. Exceptions to this pattern may be attributed to high shares of women in \\nagricultural jobs, especially in countries where the farming sector is large (for example, India). Turning to \\neducation, in all countries examined, higher education levels are associated with a greater share of \\nemployment in high-exposure occupations, but this is especially pronounced in occupations with high \\ncomplementarity (Figure 3, panel 2). The higher level of exposure supports the popular view that, unlike \\nautomation, AI could more strongly affect high-skilled workers. However, higher exposure is alleviated by \\ngreater potential for complementarity. Last, age differences do not exhibit a common pattern (Figure 3, panel \\n3). This is because the composition of different age cohorts in terms of gender and education is very distinct \\nacross countries, thus overshadowing age-based differences. In the UK and the US, younger groups have \\nmore college-educated individuals thanks to increased university attendance over the past 30 years; gender \\ncomposition of age groups is similar. In emerging market economies and low-income countries, there are fewer \\npeople with higher education, but younger groups have more women thanks to recent rises in female labor \\nparticipation. \\n \\nFigure 3. Share of Employment in High-Exposure Occupations by Demographic Groups \\n1. By Gender \\n(Percent) \\n2. By Education \\n(Percent) \\n3. By Age  \\n(Percent) \\n   \\n \\nSources: American Community Survey; Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares ; India Periodic Labour Force Survey; Labour Market Dynamics in \\nSouth Africa; Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua; UK Labour Force Survey; and IMF staff calculations.  \\nNote: The bars represent employment shares in high -exposure occupations. In panel 1, employment shares are conditional on each gender \\ncategory. In panel 2, employment shares are conditional on each of the four education categories ( middle school and below, high school, some \\ncollege, college or higher). In panel 3, employment shares are conditional on each of the four age intervals. Country labels use International \\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) country codes. \\n \\nExposure is spread along the labor income distribution, but potential gains from AI are positively \\ncorrelated with income. The share of employment in occupations at risk of displacement (high-exposure, low-\\ncomplementarity jobs; Figure 4, panel 1) is broadly similar across income quantiles (with a mildly positive slope \\nin emerging market economies). This differs from previous waves of automation and information technology \\nduring which risks of displacement were highest for middle-income earners. Consistent with popular discourse, \\nAI differs from traditional automation by potentially affecting jobs of workers throughout the income distribution. \\nHowever, employment in occupations that have a high potential for complementarity with AI (high-exposure, \\nhigh-complementarity jobs; Figure 4, panel 2) is more concentrated in the upper-income quantiles. The \\ncorrelation between earnings and potential complementarity is consistent with the findings on education level \\nand is even more pronounced for emerging market economies (Figure 4, panel 3). This suggests that AI’s \\ngains will likely disproportionately accrue to higher-income earners, especially in countries such as India and, to \\na lesser extent, the US, where complementarity steadily rises at the top of the distribution. The phenomenon \\nwill likely be more muted in countries such as the UK, where the increase in complementarity plateaus at the \\ntop.'),\n",

Worker Reallocation in the AI-Induced \\nTransformation \\nIn the long term, workers will adjust to changing skill demands and sector shifts, with some potentially \\ntransitioning to high-AI-complementarity roles and some struggling to adapt. The previous section \\nprovided a static picture of AI exposure based on the current employment composition of countries. Over time, \\nhowever, workers are likely to adapt to the evolving labor market. Although the analysis on AI exposure and \\ncomplementarity is conducted at the occupational level, it is important to make a distinction between jobs and \\nworkers. AI adoption may destroy some jobs (and displace the associated workers) and create or enhance \\nothers—but whether the incumbents are the ones who can reap the associated benefits is unclear. The \\nemployment effects will likely depend on worker characteristics, which in turn will affect their adaptability. \\nHistorical data suggest that some workers may struggle to adapt to technology-induced shifts in the job \\nmarket.6  \\n \\nHistorical job transition patterns suggest how workers could adapt. This section analyzes microdata from \\nBrazil and the UK to examine worker transition across occupations with different current AI exposure and \\n    \\n6 In the US, Cortes, Jaimovich and Siu (2017) found that less-educated young men contributed to the decline in routine manual jobs \\nsince the 1980s, while women with intermediate education led the fall in routine cognitive jobs. These workers often moved to low-\\nwage occupations or nonemployment. Most of the reallocation took place through fewer moves into these occupations from \\nunemployment and inactivity (Cortes and others 2020), suggesting that automation affected job seekers more than current workers. \\nIn the UK, Dabla-Norris, Pizzinelli, and Rappaport (2023) found that routine job decline affected women without college degrees \\ndifferently across ages: older women shifted to higher-paying jobs, while younger ones went to lower-paying manual jobs.'),\n",

In general, workers switch between similar types of occupations, indicating potentially limited \\nflexibility in adjusting to evolving labor markets. However, there is a significant fraction of switches across \\noccupations with different levels of exposure to AI. Analyzing these dynamics can provide suggestive evidence \\non possible worker movements following AI adoption and help identify potentially vulnerable groups.  \\n \\nFigure 5. Occupational Transitions for College-Educated Workers in Brazil and the United Kingdom  \\n1. Brazil \\n(Percent) \\n \\n2. United Kingdom \\n(Percent) \\n \\n \\nSources: Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua; UK Labour Force Survey; and IMF staff calculations.  \\nNote: “From” indicates the exposure category of the occupation the individual had in the preceding quarter; “to” indicates the exposure category of \\nthe occupation the worker transitioned to. The share of transitions represents the average share of transitions in the “from”  category for college-\\neducated workers who go to the “to” category. \\n \\nWorkers with a college education have historically shown a greater ability to transition into what are \\nnow jobs with high AI-complementarity potential. Both college- and non-college-educated workers \\nfrequently change occupations. The average yearly occupation-switching probability is 43.7 percent in Brazil \\nand 29.8 percent in the UK for college-educated workers and 38 percent and 27 percent for non-college-\\neducated workers.9 College-educated individuals working in what are or may become AI-intensive jobs tend to \\nstay within such environments when they switch jobs, irrespective of AI’s complementarity to their roles (Figure \\n5). In addition, more than a third of those moving away from low-complementarity jobs shift toward roles with \\nhigher AI complementarity, which demonstrates a potential avenue for job growth. Non-college-educated \\nworkers are predominantly found in low-AI-exposure jobs and are less inclined to move to high-\\ncomplementarity positions when they switch from high-exposure, low-complementarity occupations.10 \\n \\n    \\n7 Annex 3 provides details on the data used for the analysis, and Cazzaniga and others (forthcoming) describe the methodology \\nand perform further analysis. The analysis in this section is conducted only for the UK and Brazil because the labor force surveys for \\nthese two countries are structured as rotating panels, which allows for tracking individual workers over time. The analysis, however, \\ncomes with a caveat: cohort effects are not included because of the limited time series dimension of the data. \\n8 Gender is not directly discussed in this section because the main results presented below for each education group hold for both \\nmales and females separately.  \\n9 These values are broadly in line with other evidence on occupational mobility in advanced economies and emerging markets. For \\ninstance, for the US, Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) estimate a yearly occupation switching rate of 21 percent, while Moscarini \\nand Vella (2008) estimate a monthly rate of 3.5 percent, equivalent to 34.7 percent annually. Meanwhile, for Brazil, Monsueto, \\nMoreira Cunha, and da Silva Bichara (2014) estimate a 30 percent occupation switching rate over a period of four months. \\n10 Industry switches also happen, but the classification of AI exposure and complementarity has not been conducted at the industry \\nlevel. While some occupations are industry-specific (for example, doctors typically work in health care), others are more versatile \\nand can cross into other industries.'),\n",

Figure 6 shows that college-educated workers often transition from low- to high-complementarity jobs \\nin their 20s and 30s. Their career progression stabilizes by their late 30s to early 50s, when they usually have \\nreached senior roles and are less inclined to make significant job switches. Although non-college-educated \\nworkers show similar patterns, their progression is less pronounced, and they occupy fewer high-exposure \\npositions. This suggests that young, educated workers are exposed to both potential labor market disruptions \\nand opportunities in occupations likely to be affected by AI. On one hand, if low-complementarity positions, \\nsuch as clerical jobs, serve as stepping stones toward high-complementarity jobs, a reduction in the demand \\nfor low-complementarity occupations could make young high-skilled workers’ entry into the labor market more \\ndifficult. On the other hand, AI may enable young college-educated workers to become experienced more \\nquickly as they leverage their familiarity with new technologies to enhance their productivity. With the \\nintroduction of generative AI, the use of AI has itself become much easier. A recent study shows that the \\nproductivity impact of an AI-based conversational assistant was greatest for less experienced and low-skilled \\ncustomer support workers; the effect on experienced and highly skilled workers was minimal (Brynjolfsson, \\nDanielle, and Raymond 2023). \\n \\nOlder workers may be less adaptable and face additional barriers to mobility, as reflected in their lower \\nlikelihood of reemployment after termination. Following job termination, older workers are less likely to \\nsecure new employment within a year than young and prime-age workers (Figure 7). Several factors can \\nexplain this discrepancy. First, older workers’ skills, though once in high demand, may now be obsolete as a \\nresult of rapid technological advances. Moreover, after significant time in a particular location, they may have \\ngeographic and emotional ties, such as to a spouse and children, that discourage them from relocation for new \\njob opportunities. Financial obligations accumulated over the years might also make them less likely to accept \\npositions with a pay cut. Last, having invested many years, if not decades, in a particular sector or occupation, \\nthere may be a natural reluctance or even a perceptual barrier to a transition to entirely new roles or industries. \\nThis may reflect a combination of comfort with familiar settings, concern about the learning curve in a new \\ndomain, or perceived age bias. These constraints are likely to be relevant also in the context of AI-induced \\ndisruptions.'),\n",

After unemployment, older \\nworkers previously employed in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations are less likely to find \\njobs in the same category of occupation than prime-age workers (Figure 7). This difference in the \\nreemployment dynamics can reflect technological change, changes in workers’ preferences, and age-related \\nbiases or stereotypes in the hiring processes in high-complementarity and high-exposure occupations. \\nTechnological change may affect older workers through the need to learn new skills. Firms may not find it \\nbeneficial to invest in teaching new skills to workers with a shorter career horizon; older workers may also be \\nless likely to engage in such training, since the perceived benefit may be limited given the limited remaining \\nyears of employment. This effect can be magnified by the generosity of pension and unemployment insurance \\nprograms.11 These channels align with Braxton and Taska (2023), which finds that technology contributes 45 \\npercent of earnings losses following unemployment. This happens primarily because workers lacking new skills \\nmove to jobs where their existing skills are valued but that garner lower wages. \\n \\nOccupational switches also affect workers’ incomes. In both the Brazil and the UK, progressing to high-\\nexposure, high-complementarity occupations is associated with higher wages (Figure 8).12 Greater access to \\nthese types of jobs could thus be an significant driver of income growth for workers in advanced and emerging \\nmarket and developing economies. In Brazil (Figure 8, panel 1), workers switching to low-exposure from high-\\nexposure occupations tend to experience a contraction in hourly wages. Hence, such transitions may be \\nassociated with income losses. \\n \\n    \\n11 See for example Yashiro and others (2022), who find that in Finland, older workers in occupations more exposed to digital \\ntechnologies are more likely to exit employment each year, and this effect is amplified when the workers can access an extension of \\nbenefits, known as the “unemployment tunnel,” which extends unemployment benefits until retirement. \\n12 A large amount of literature, starting with Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) finds that occupational mobility is an important driver \\nof wage growth at the individual level and of wage inequality across workers.'),\n",

AI, Productivity, and Inequality \\nIn this section, a model-based analysis is used to evaluate the potential impact of AI adoption on the \\neconomy and inequality. This analytical approach serves as a complement to the preceding empirical \\nfindings by examining broader effects on the economy, highlighting three critical channels through which AI \\nmay affect it: (1) labor displacement, (2) complementarity, and (3) productivity gains. These three channels are \\nessential to gauging the potential impact of AI adoption. First, AI adoption may shift tasks previously performed \\nby labor to AI capital, leading to a reduction in labor income. Second, AI adoption may increase the importance \\nof tasks that are not displaced by AI, particularly in occupations with high complementarity between human \\nlabor and AI. This leads to a shift in value added and labor demand toward occupations with high AI \\ncomplementarity and away from other occupations. Third, AI adoption may lead to broad-based productivity \\ngains, boosting investment and increasing overall labor demand, which may offset some of the decline in labor \\nincome caused by AI-induced labor displacement. As a result, the overall impact of AI on income levels and \\ninequality will depend on the extent to which gains in economic activity generated by AI-induced productivity \\ncompensate for any labor income losses.'),\n",

A task-based model, detailed in Rockall, Pizzinelli, and Tavares (forthcoming), \\nis developed. The model builds on the work of Drozd, Taschereau-Dumouchel, and Tavares (2022) and Moll, \\nRachel, and Restrepo (2022). Agents differ by their labor productivity and asset holdings, offering a rich picture \\nof the income and wealth distribution. AI is assumed to be adopted at its maximum potential and affects agents \\naccording to their AI exposure and complementarity potential. Within this analytical framework, AI's effect on \\nincome operates primarily through the three channels mentioned above. AI adoption also leads to increases in \\nthe return on capital, raising capital income, which in turn increases wealth and wealth inequality consistently \\nwith the initial distribution of asset holdings. \\n \\nThe model is calibrated to the United Kingdom, a country that is highly exposed to AI adoption. \\nWorkers’ income is divided into three categories: (1) labor income, which can be positively or negatively \\nexposed to AI depending on its degree of complementarity with workers’ skills; (2) capital income, which \\nincreases with AI adoption; and (3) benefits and other income (government benefits, pensions, and so forth).13 \\nFigure 9, panel 1, shows that high-income workers have a much larger share of capital income than middle- \\nand low-income workers, suggesting that this source of income may play a crucial role in determining the \\nincome inequality impact of AI adoption. Middle- and low-income workers’ total income depends more on labor \\nincome. The impact of AI on labor income will vary with workers’ AI exposure and complementarity. In line with \\nthe evidence presented in Section II, Figure 9, panel 2, shows that workers’ exposure to AI increases with their \\nincome. However, workers’ potential complementarity with AI also increases with income, albeit in the case of \\nthe UK, it peaks around the 75th percentile, declining slightly thereafter.  \\n \\nThe impact of AI is simulated by building three scenarios, which assume a labor share decline in line \\nwith comparable historical episodes associated with automation. The decrease in the labor share has \\nhistorically been associated with routine-biased automation and, to a lesser extent, with increased trade, \\ngrowing markups, and declining worker bargaining power resulting from the weakening of labor unions.14 \\nDrawing on the change observed in the UK between 1980 and 2014 as a possible scenario, we assume that \\nthe labor share declines by 5.5 percentage points following the introduction of AI. This impact is spread across \\nthe income distribution, depending on workers’ AI exposure and complementarity, as shown in Figure 9, panel \\n2. The three scenarios embed the same displacement of labor tasks via the capital deepening effect but are  \\ndifferentiated by (1) low-complementarity, if AI only mildly increases the demand for high-complementarity \\noccupations; (2) high-complementarity, if AI strongly supports the demand for high-complementarity \\noccupations; and (3) high-complementarity and high productivity, if AI strongly complements high-\\ncomplementary occupations, as in scenario (2), and further augments the productivity of the economy, \\npredominantly through workers in high-complementarity occupations. The productivity increase is calibrated to \\ngenerate close to a 1.5 percentage point increase in the workers’ average annual productivity growth rate in the \\nfirst 10 years after AI adoption. This value is at the lower end of firm-level studies estimating the potential \\nimpact of AI adoption on workers’ productivity (as discussed in Briggs and Kodnani 2023).15\"),\n",

In panel 2, AI exposure is measured as the share of total hours worked in a job in \\nthe top 30 percent of AI Occupational Exposure scores, from Felten, Raj, and Seamans (2021), weighted by hours worked. This threshold is chosen \\nto make the analysis comparable with historical episodes of automation. AI complementarity is measured by considering work contexts and skills, as \\ndiscussed in Box 1 and in detail in Pizzinelli and others (2023). In the panel, we plot AI exposure and complementarity by total income percentiles.  \\nRHS = right scale. \\n \\nThe impact of AI on labor income inequality depends on the race between the degree of exposure to, \\nand complementarity with, AI, and its boost to productivity.16 When AI has low complementarity with labor, \\nAI adoption leads to a decline in labor income inequality (Figure 10) because of the displacement effect. At the \\ntop of the income distribution the displacement effect is larger than the complementarity gains, leading to a \\nlabor income decline at the top. When AI is highly complementary to labor, the complementarity effect becomes \\nstronger than the displacement effect, particularly in the upper half of the income distribution, leading to a \\nsmaller share of high-income workers negatively affected by AI compared with the low-complementarity case. \\nThe share of workers negatively affected at the top drops from almost 15 percent to less than 5 percent. This \\nhigh complementarity also leads to a decline in the labor income of those with less complementary tasks, who \\nare typically among low-income workers. As a consequence, labor income inequality increases. Last, when the \\nAI productivity impact is also considered, labor income rises for all workers in the economy, even for the \\nworkers who have low exposure and those with high exposure and low complementarity. The main reason is \\nthat higher productivity leads to higher demand for all factors of production in the economy, leading to \\nincreased labor income. However, labor income inequality rises because the increase is larger for workers with \\nhigh AI complementarity. \\n \\nUnlike labor income inequality, capital income and wealth inequality always increase with AI adoption \\n(Figure 10). The main reason for the increase in capital income and wealth inequality is that AI leads to labor \\ndisplacement and an increase in the demand for AI capital, increasing capital returns and asset holdings' value. \\nIn all scenarios, interest rates increase by almost 0.4 percentage point, with the potential to partially offset the \\ndecline in the natural rate of interest in the UK and advanced economies in general.17 Since in the model, as in \\n    \\n16 Annex 4 discusses two additional hypothetical scenarios that disentangle the importance of exposure and complementarity.  \\n17 The increase in the interest rate is approximately of the same magnitude as the decline in the UK natural rate attributable to \\ndemographics (IMF 2023).\"),\n",

These model simulations abstract from possible changes in the \\ndefinition of property rights, as well as changes in fiscal and redistributive policies, which can help reshape \\ndistributional outcomes (see, for example, Berg and others 2021, in the context of automation; and Klinova and \\nKorinek 2021, in the context of AI). \\n \\nFigure 10.

For all scenarios, the calibrated change in the capital share is the same: 5.5 percentage points, based on the change in the capital share \\nduring 1980–2014. The panels show the change in total income by income percentile, decomposed into the change in labor income in blue and the \\nchange in capital income in orange. For more details on the model see Annex 4. P = percentile. \\n \\nUnder the high-complementarity, high-productivity scenario, the increase in total national income is \\nlargest and benefits all workers, although gains for those at the top are larger. In the first scenario, in \\nwhich AI has low complementarity, the use of AI leads to an increase in output of almost 10 percent thanks to a  \\ncombination of capital deepening and a small increase \\nin total factor productivity (Figure 11). When higher \\ncomplementarity is considered (second scenario), the AI \\nimpact on output and total factor productivity is similar to \\nthe impact in the low-complementarity scenario because \\nthese scenarios assume the same capital deepening \\nand capital productivity gains. However, higher \\ncomplementarity leads to sectoral reallocation, with \\nlabor demand and economic activity moving from low- to \\nhigh-complementarity occupations.

These gains happen primarily in the first 10 years of the transition. Under this \\nthird scenario, despite the increase in labor income inequality, the total income level increases for all workers in \\nthe economy, ranging from 2 percent for low-income workers to almost 14 percent for high-income workers.  \\n \\nIn emerging market and developing economies with higher initial inequality, AI could amplify wealth \\ngaps and reduce wage disparity to a larger extent, but if the exposure to AI is lower and widespread, it \\ncould dampen these effects. An important issue is how model results may change when considering two \\naspects pertinent to emerging market and developing economies: (1) higher initial levels of income and wealth \\ninequality and (2) lower exposure to AI. Simulations suggest that higher initial income and wealth inequality \\ncould exacerbate wealth disparity, because AI-associated gains accrue predominantly to top earners. At the \\nsame time, labor income inequality could decrease to a larger extent because of a higher concentration of AI-\\nexposed workers at the top of the income distribution. The final effect, however, depends on the degree of \\ncomplementarity, as in the case of advanced economies. In an economy with fewer AI-exposed workers, the \\ndirect impact of AI on both income and wealth distribution may be less pronounced, given that fewer people \\nstand to benefit from AI.18 Last, AI’s potential to enhance public services, modernize finance, and bolster such \\nsectors as agriculture and health care could boost inclusion and productivity in emerging market and \\ndeveloping economies. Although these aspects are outside the scope of the model analysis, they are \\ndiscussed in Box 2. \\n \\nAlthough the model simulations focus on within-country inequality, AI adoption may also have \\nsignificant effects on global economic disparity, driven by potential reshoring of activities to advanced \\neconomies. Such a shift could trigger reallocation of capital and labor from less developed regions, which are \\nnot as prepared to harness AI, toward more technologically advanced and AI-ready countries (Alonso and \\nothers 2022). Call centers located in emerging market economies are a potential example. These could be at \\nrisk of replacement by AI-driven solutions, subsequently leading to their relocation to advanced economies. In \\naddition to labor reallocation, the increased profitability of firms that adopt AI may generate an influx of capital \\nfrom emerging market and developing economies to advanced economies, which could reduce equilibrium \\ninterest rates in advanced economies and exert downward pressure on capital income.19 Clearly, these \\ndynamics are highly uncertain at this stage. It is also possible that, with sufficient investment, AI may help \\nemerging market and developing economies leapfrog in certain sectors, facilitating the offshoring of a broader \\nselection of tasks and thus reducing cross-country inequality. \\n \\nV. AI Preparedness \\nPreparedness for AI adoption is essential to harness its potential and mitigate its inherent risks. AI \\nadoption can result in diverse labor market outcomes across countries, particularly regarding workforce \\nreallocation and inequality. These likely varied outcomes are intertwined with countries’ structural and \\ninstitutional frameworks. A country's level of preparedness plays a pivotal role when it comes to maximizing \\nAI's benefits while managing downside risks, as historical episodes of technology adoption demonstrate (Cirera, \\nComin, and Cruz 2022).  \\n    \\n18 An important caveat regards the extent to which wealthy people in emerging market and developing economies have invested in \\nforeign stocks likely to benefit from AI adoption.

Drawing from the literature on the cross-country determinants of technology diffusion (for example, \\nKeller 2004) and adoption (for example, Nicoletti, Rueden, and Andrews 2020), the index is made up of a \\nselected set of macro-structural indicators that are relevant for AI adoption. These are organized under four \\ncategories: (1) digital infrastructure, (2) innovation and economic integration, (3) human capital and labor \\nmarket policies, and (4) regulation and ethics. Annex 5 contains the full list of subindicators and details on the \\nindex construction methodology. \\n \\nAlthough each component of the AIPI is important individually, preparedness for AI-induced structural \\ntransformation will likely rely on the collective performance in all areas. For example, the digital \\ninfrastructure component, a crucial determinant of information and communications technology adoption (for \\nexample, Nicoletti, Rueden, and Andrews 2020) can lay the foundation for the diffusion and localized \\napplications of AI technology. Nonetheless, such infrastructure would be of limited use absent a skilled \\nworkforce capable of leveraging digital platforms for innovative workplace applications (Bartel, Ichniowski, and \\nShaw 2007). Therefore, the human capital and labor market policies element, which incorporates the presence \\nof social safety nets, assesses the prevalence and inclusive distribution of digital skills within the labor force \\nand the presence of policies that facilitate labor reallocation while safeguarding those harmed by AI-induced \\ntransitions (Nicoletti, Rueden, and Andrews 2020). Coupled with strong infrastructure, a digitally skilled labor \\nforce is vital for innovation and economic integration (Autor, Levy, and Murnane 2003), which not only fosters \\ndomestic technological development through a vibrant R&D ecosystem but also promotes international trade \\nand attracts foreign investment and new (AI) technologies (Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen 2015). Last, the \\nregulation and ethics dimension evaluates the extent to which the existing legal frameworks are adaptable to \\nevolving new (digital) business models and the \\npresence of strong governance for effective \\nenforcement.  \\n \\nWealthier economies, including advanced and \\nsome emerging market economies, are generally \\nbetter prepared than low-income countries to \\nadopt AI, although there is considerable variation \\nacross countries (Figure 12). Broadly, advanced \\nand some emerging market economies are highly \\nexposed to potential disruptions from AI—amid a \\nsubstantial share of employment in highly exposed \\noccupations. Yet these highly exposed economies, \\nnotably the UK and US, as analyzed in Section II, are \\nalso well positioned to harness the benefits and \\nmitigate the risks of AI thanks to their strong \\npreparedness, particularly in digital infrastructure, \\nhuman capital, and adaptable regulatory frameworks. \\nOn the other hand, low-income countries, although \\nrelatively less exposed, are underprepared across all \\ndimensions to harness the benefits of AI. Notably, \\nweak digital infrastructure and a less digitally skilled \\nlabor force are a concern. These  \\nFigure 12.

In this context, it is useful to distinguish \\nbetween foundational AI preparedness—digital infrastructure and human capital that enable workers and firms \\nto adopt AI—and second-generation preparedness (innovation and legal frameworks). For economies with high \\nAI exposure and strong foundational AI adoption preparedness (advanced economies and some emerging \\nmarket economies), more emphasis should be placed on strengthening their digital innovation capacity and \\nadapting their legal and ethical frameworks to govern and foster AI advances. Accordingly, improvement in \\nregulatory frameworks—which are critical for broadening societal trust in AI tools—followed by innovation and \\nintegration, are the AI preparedness dimensions more strongly correlated with the size of the digital sector in \\nadvanced economies (Figure 13, panels 3 and 4). Regulatory frameworks need to mitigate cybersecurity risks \\nas well (Carriere-Swallow and Haksar 2019; Haksar and others 2021), which increase with widespread use of \\nAI (Bank of America 2023) and may adversely affect firms’ performance (Jamilov, Rey, and Tahoun 2023). \\nWhere foundational preparedness is weak (low-income countries and some emerging market economies),'),\n",

In other words, while the capacity to innovate and \\nstrengthen regulatory frameworks for digital businesses is crucial in attracting (digital) investments in low-\\nincome countries, these frameworks will be less effective without strong AI infrastructure and a digitally skilled \\nlabor force. In some emerging market economies and low-income countries where foundational preparedness \\nis not a strong binding constraint, improvement in innovation and regulatory frameworks could catalyze private \\ninvestment in digital innovations. The correlations reported in Figure 13 (panels 1 and 2) corroborate these \\narguments, with digital Infrastructure and human capital strongly associated with the digital sector size in low-\\nincome countries. With such investments, AI has the potential to improve the delivery of fundamental services \\nsuch as education and health care and could perform complex tasks in areas where skilled labor is scarce. \\nHowever, considering the costs associated with such investments and the limited fiscal space in many low-\\nincome countries, it would be prudent to focus spending on high-return projects. \\n \\nVI. Conclusions and Policy Considerations \\nAI adoption may generate labor market shifts with significant cross-country differences. The exact \\nimplications of AI for economies and societies are challenging to predict, embodying a level of uncertainty \\nreminiscent of past introductions of general-purpose technologies, such as electricity. This uncertainty is \\nparticularly pronounced in labor markets, where AI offers productivity gains but also poses risks of job \\ndisplacements. This note’s findings highlight the significant portion of global employment that is exposed to AI, \\nwith advanced economies generally both more exposed but also better positioned to leverage this technology \\nthan most emerging market and developing economies. This dynamic suggests a potential widening of the \\ndigital divide and global income disparity.  \\n \\nWomen and highly educated workers are consistently more exposed to, but also more likely to benefit \\nfrom, AI; older workers may be more likely to struggle during this technological transition. Both women, \\nwith their strong presence in the services sector, and highly educated workers, typically employed in cognitive-\\nintensive occupations, face greater AI exposure. Yet both groups also stand to gain the most from its \\nintegration. College-educated and younger people move more easily into high-complementarity jobs; older \\nworkers, however, face challenges in reemployment and adapting to new technologies, mobility, and acquiring \\nnew job skills. \\nBeyond its impact on income levels, which could increase for most workers, AI will also reshape wealth \\nand income distribution. Capital deepening and the surge in productivity driven by AI hold the potential to \\nelevate wage incomes for a broad range of workers and to increase total income. This is more likely if AI \\nexhibits significant complementarity with human labor in several roles and if the productivity boost is sufficiently \\nstrong. The enhanced economic activity and labor demand spurred by AI could offset the negative \\nconsequences of labor displacement. Unlike previous automation waves, which affected mostly middle-skilled \\nworkers, AI's displacement risks span the entire income spectrum, including high-income earners and skilled \\nprofessionals. However, the potential for AI to complement jobs is positively correlated with income levels. As \\nsuch, the trajectory of labor income inequality hinges on how well AI complements tasks undertaken by high-\\nincome professionals.

Artificial Intelligence Occupational Exposure and Potential \\nComplementarity  \\n \\nSeveral studies have proposed definitions of AI exposure at the occupational level. The most common \\nis the AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) index of Felten, Raj, and Seamans (2021), measuring the \\ncorrespondence between 10 AI applications and 52 human skills. This overlap between AI and human \\nabilities is then weighted by the degree of importance and complexity of such skills in each job. This index is \\ninterpreted in relative terms and reported as normalized or rescaled between 0 and 1. It is also agnostic \\nabout the implication of exposure for human labor. In other words, it focuses on the relative likelihood of AI’s \\nintegration into the functions of a given job, but it does not consider the likelihood of AI serving as a \\ncomplementary technology or subsituting for human labor.  \\n \\nSome studies build on the AIOE measure to attempt to answer this question. Pizzinelli and others \\n(2023) propose a potential complementarity index to adjust the original AIOE measure. In this \\napproach, greater potential complementarity reduces exposure. Hence, a higher complementarity-adjusted \\nAIOE (C-AIOE) more explicitly reflects a higher chance of labor substitution. To develop this index, the \\nauthors use O*NET, the same repository of occupational characterisitcs employed by Felten, Raj, and \\nSeamans (2021), but draw from two different areas: work contexts and skills. Work contexts include social \\nand physical aspects of how work in a given occupation is carried out. Using case-by-case judgment, the \\nauthors argue that in some contexts societies may be less likely to allow unsupervised use of AI. For \\ninstance, the criticality of decisions and the gravity of the consequences of errors are two job aspects that \\nmay motivate societies to require humans to make final decisions or take actions. Judges and doctors, for \\nexample, despite high AI exposure, would still likely be human beings. \\n \\nConceptually, exposure and complementarity can be \\nthought of as two dimensions of relevance, as in Box \\nFigure 1.1.  At the first stage, exposure (x-axis) defines the \\nscope for applying AI to carry out the main functions of a job. At \\nthe second stage, given the degree of potential application, a \\nset of societal and technical concerns determines \\ncomplementarity. For occupations with high exposure, low \\ncomplementarity entails a relatively higher likelihood of AI \\nreplacing key tasks. In more acute cases, AI may lead to a \\ndecrease in the demand for the occupation altogether. This \\nwould in turn translate into reduced employment prospects, \\nlower wages, and higher risk of displacment. High exposure \\ncombined with high complementarity entails a greater likelihood \\nof workers in those jobs experiencing productivity growth and \\nwage gains from adopting AI-driven technologies. However, \\nthese benefits will likely be contingent on possessing the skills \\nneeded to use AI. Without such skills, workers may be at a \\ndisadvantage and may experience lower compensation and reduced employment prospects. Last, at lower \\nlevels of exposure, complementarity becomes less relevant, because the tasks in an occupation that are \\nlikely to be either supported or replaced by AI are less integral components of the job itself (see Annex 2 for \\nadditional details).  \\nThis box was prepared by Carlo Pizzinelli. \\nBox Figure 1.1.

Artificial-Intelligence-Led Innovation and the Potential for Greater \\nInclusion \\n \\nGrowing AI adoption has the potential to exacerbate cross-country and within-country inequality. \\nThis box argues, however, that there are also several avenues through which AI could be leveraged to foster \\ninclusion in developing economies. Enhancing inclusion in the delivery of public services that focus on \\nboosting human capital, such as health care and education, as well as in agriculture and credit access, \\npresents a promising avenue through which AI can augment productivity. \\n \\nOne example is the transformative role of digitalization in government technology (\"govtech\"). \\nHistorically, digitalization has helped modernize public finance by enhancing revenue collection and \\nspending efficiency. It has also improved the delivery of social services, thereby fostering inclusion and \\nreducing inequality (Amaglobeli and others 2023). Notably, during COVID-19–related lockdowns, nations \\nsuch as Namibia, Peru, Zambia, and Uganda successfully used their digital infrastructure to expedite the \\ndistribution of financial aid. AI could amplify this wave of transformation by assisting in informed decision-\\nmaking, identifying service gaps, detecting fraud and corruption, and customizing local interventions.  \\n \\nBy streamlining bureaucratic tasks, AI tools could also free up time and resources, which could be \\nbetter allocated to key sectors for inclusion—for example, agriculture, health care, and education. \\nInterventions in these sectors benefit primarily the socially and economically vulnerable. In agriculture, AI \\ncould be leveraged to predict yields, optimize irrigation, and identify potential pests, thereby enhancing food \\nsecurity and productivity (IFC 2020). In health care, AI could assist in predictive analytics to foresee \\noutbreaks, optimize resource allocation in hospitals, facilitate diagnoses, and make quality health care \\naccessible and affordable even in areas with shortages of qualified medical staff (Wahl and others 2018; \\nUSAID 2019). In education, personalized learning experiences could be delivered through AI algorithms, \\nreducing the human capital divide in regions lacking qualified educators (UNESCO 2021).  \\n \\nAI also holds the promise of advancing financial inclusion, specifically by using unconventional data \\nto evaluate creditworthiness (IFC 2020). This would allow underserved communities to gain access to \\nfinancial services that would otherwise be out of reach. Given the risks associated with AI technologies—\\nsuch as potential embedded bias and opaque outcomes (Shabsigh and Boukherouaa 2023)—their \\ndeployment should be accompanied by stronger frameworks for monitoring and oversight (Boukherouaa and \\nothers 2021; FCA 2022). The expansion of digital financial services has historically been linked with \\nincreased inclusion. An IMF study (Sahay and Čihák 2020) analyzed 52 emerging market and developing \\neconomies and underscored a marked rise in digital financial inclusion, with notable progress in Africa and \\nAsia. COVID-19 further accelerated the growth of digital financial services, which tend to benefit low-income \\nhouseholds and small businesses while promoting economic growth and reducing inequality (Sahay and \\nothers 2017; Sahay and Čihák 2020).  \\n \\nWhile AI adoption promises transformative change, its successful implementation requires substantial \\ninvestment, political commitment, and safeguards for data security and privacy. \\n \\nThis box was prepared by Giovanni Melina.'),\n",

Additional Information on AI \\nOccupational Exposure and Potential \\nComplementarity  \\nAnnex Figure 2.1, panel 1, plots the distribution of AI occupational exposure (AIOE) and complementarity for \\nindividual  occupations within each major occupational group (that is, 4-digit occupation within each major \\ngroup of the International Standard Classification of Occupations [ISCO]-08 classification). As is evident, some \\noccupational groups are, on average, characterized both by high exposure and high complementarity, such as \\nprofessionals, managers, and technicians. Others have both high exposure and low complementarity, such as \\nclerical workers. Another important observation is that, in general, compared with exposure, the dispersion of \\npotential complementarity is larger within than across occupational groups, suggesting that the factors that may \\ndetermine complementarity are cut across the spectrum of jobs.  \\n \\nGiven potential complementarity, θ, a complementarity-adjusted AI occupational exposure (C-AIOE) measure \\ncan be constructed as follows: C-AIOE = AIOE *(1– θ – θMIN)). The adjustment lowers exposure for \\noccupations with higher values of θ relative to the occupation with the lowest complementarity (θMIN).                   \\n \\nAnnex Figure 2.1, panel 2 compares AIOE and C-AIOE. For professionals and managers, the average \\nexposure is much lower after the complementarity adjustment. Meanwhile, clerical occupations, on average, \\nhave the highest complementarity-adjusted exposure, suggesting that they are the most vulnerable to \\ndisruption. Last, for occupational groups with average exposure that was already low, the adjustment does not \\nsubstantially change their relative position in the ranking compared with the unadjusted measure.  \\n \\nAnnex Figure 2.1.

Methodology for the Worker Transition \\nAnalysis \\nIII.1 Data \\nTo analyze worker reallocation between occupations in Section III, this note uses the panel structure of the UK \\nLabor Force Survey (LFS) and Brazil’s Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua (PNADC, \\nNational Continuous Household Sampling Survey). Both surveys have a similar design: households are \\ninterviewed quarterly, and they remain in the sample for five quarters (rolling replacement survey).  \\nAlthough the PNADC survey identifies households across quarters, it does not identify the number of people \\nwithin households. Thus, a matching algorithm must be used to identify individuals across quarters based on \\nindividual characteristics. The note uses the algorithm proposed by Ribas and Soares (2008) and implemented \\nby Datazoom. \\nIII.2 Constructing Worker Flows \\nUsing the panel data, it is possible to estimate the employment flows and construct the transition matrices \\nshown in Annex Table 3.1. A transition from unemployment to inactivity (U2N), for example, is defined as \\nhappening when a worker is inactive in the current quarter but was unemployed in the previous quarter. \\nSimilarly, a transition from high-exposure employment to low-exposure employment (HE2LE) is defined as \\nhappening when a worker is employed in an occupation code with exposure above the median in the current \\nquarter but was employed in an occupation code with exposure below the median in the previous quarter. \\nAn occupational switch, or transition, is defined as happening when a worker reports an occupation code in the \\nquarter that differs from the occupation code reported in the previous quarter. This includes both job-to-job \\ntransitions (when the worker changes employer) and on-the-job transitions (when the worker switches \\noccupations but remains with the same employer). \\nIII.3 Wage Dynamics \\nThe UK LFS reports wage data only in the first and final waves of a household’s participation in the survey. \\nThus, for the analysis shown in Figure 7, the note considers transitions and wage changes over a period of one \\nyear instead of one quarter. Even though for Brazil wage data are available for all five waves a household \\nparticipates in the survey, transitions are still considered over a year so as to keep the methodology consistent \\nwith that used for the UK. \\nThe wage variation is constructed as the variation in the log gross hourly wages between the fifth and first \\nquarters an individual is in the survey. The following regression specification is run for both countries: \\n \\n𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛿𝛿1𝐽𝐽2𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿2𝐽𝐽2𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑂𝑂𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿3𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 \\n+ �𝜃𝜃𝑘𝑘\\n\\u2008\\n𝑘𝑘\\n𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖−1)\\n𝑘𝑘 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖\\n𝑘𝑘 + ��𝜙𝜙𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘\\n\\u2008\\n𝑘𝑘\\n\\u2008\\n𝑘𝑘\\n𝑂𝑂𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖−1)\\n𝑘𝑘 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖\\n𝑘𝑘 𝑗𝑗  \\n+𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖. \\n \\nHere, i refers to the individual in the survey, t is the quarter, and r the geographic region, such that 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is a year-\\nquarter fixed effect and 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 a region fixed effect.

J2J is a \\ndummy variable representing job-to-job transitions, defined as happening when workers have been with their \\ncurrent employer for less than 12 months in wave 5 of the survey and were employed in wave 1.

Last, 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖\\n𝑘𝑘  is a dummy for a worker in exposure category k in period \\nt. \\nThus, the θ𝑘𝑘 coefficient represents the log wage change for “stayers” in category k; that is, those who did not \\nswitch occupations, while ϕ𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 is the change for those who changed occupation from exposure category k to \\nexposure category j.

Growth in high-exposure, high-\\ncomplementarity occupations will likely be in the formal sector, as these roles mostly require skilled, formally \\nemployed workers. Hence, AI’s growth will not necessarily move workers from the informal to the formal sector. \\nHowever, workers displaced from high-exposure, low-complementarity occupations may face job loss and \\nmove to informality. Evidence from Brazil, however, indicates a limited risk of such a double blow (Annex \\nFigure 3.1). A large share of employment in low-exposure occupations is in formal work arrangements (panel \\n1)—though this finding may not necessarily extend to other emerging market economies. Moreover, most \\noccupational switches of formal workers have not involved movement into the informal sector (panel 2).'),\n",

Model Details \\nThis annex gives a brief overview of the model’s main elements and considers two extreme scenarios that \\nillustrate the main channels through which AI adoption affects the economy. The model details are in a paper \\nby Rockall, Pizzinelli, and Tavares (forthcoming), which combines the models of Drozd, Taschereau-\\nDumouchel, and Tavares (2023) and Moll, Rachel, and Restrepo (2022).  \\nIV.1 Main Model Features \\n \\nTime in the model is viewed as continuous. The final consumption good is produced using intermediate goods \\nobtained using a continuum of tasks aggregated according to a Cobb-Douglas production function. Tasks can \\nbe produced using labor or capital. Agents are heterogeneous in their skills and ability to invest in capital \\nmarkets, leading to variations in their capital endowments. Agents supply labor inelastically across different \\nsectors and are subject to dissipation shocks. Different sectors pay different wages, and agents who invest in \\nbonds receive the risk-free rate, whereas those who invest in capital markets receive a higher rate equal to the \\nreturn on capital. Agents maximize standard preferences over utility flows from consumption subject to a \\nbudget constraint and a natural debt limit. The heterogeneity in skill types and investment allows the model to \\nreplicate income and wealth inequality. \\n \\nIn the model, there are three main channels through which AI adoption affects the economy. First, labor \\ndisplacement arises because tasks performed by labor are carried out by capital, given that technological \\nprogress makes it feasible for AI to perform those tasks. It is assumed that capital is more productive than labor \\nat performing those tasks, making labor displacement productivity-enhancing. Second, complementarity \\nreallocates value added, and hence labor demand and income, from workers with less AI complementarity to \\nworkers with high AI complementarity. It is assumed that the complementarity channel does not affect the \\noverall labor share in the economy. Third, the productivity channel increases the output and wages of workers \\nwith high AI complementarity. \\n \\nThe model’s Cobb-Douglas production function is as follows: \\n \\nin which 𝜂𝜂𝑧𝑧 denotes the importance in value added of the tasks that can be performed by skill z, 𝜓𝜓𝑧𝑧 denotes the \\nproductivity of labor for these tasks, and K denotes the aggregate stock of capital in the economy. In this \\nmodel, the displacement channel is characterized by changes in 𝛼𝛼𝑧𝑧, the complementarity channel by changes \\nin 𝜂𝜂𝑧𝑧, and the productivity channel by changes in 𝜓𝜓𝑧𝑧.  \\n \\nIV.2 Additional Scenarios \\n \\nTwo hypothetical scenarios are reported to highlight the impact of the displacement and the complementarity \\nchannels. In the first scenario, the displacement effect affects all workers equally, while complementarity affects \\nworkers according to the data shown in Figure 9, panel 2. In the second scenario, the complementarity channel \\nis deactivated, and displacement occurs according to the data reported in Figure 9, panel 2.'),\n",

However, workers with \\nhigh AI complementarity experience an increase in the demand for tasks that were not displaced at the \\nexpense of workers with low AI complementarity. The combination of these two effects causes workers with \\nhigh AI complementarity (who are also high-income workers, as in the data) to accrue most of the gains in \\nproductivity generated by AI adoption. Consequently, AI adoption leads to more significant labor income and \\nwealth inequality under this scenario. \\n \\nIn contrast, when the AI exposure impact increases with income and there is no complementarity (Annex \\nFigure 4.1, panel 2), the income gains from adopting AI are higher at the bottom of the income distribution. This \\nhappens because workers at the bottom of the income distribution are less exposed to AI and thus suffer less \\ntask displacement. In contrast, higher-income workers are more exposed and consequently suffer greater task \\ndisplacement. As a result, under this scenario, AI adoption leads to lower income inequality since the gains in \\ncapital income are not enough to compensate for the lower gains in labor income at the top caused by task \\ndisplacement. \\n \\nThese two scenarios illustrate the importance of how exposure and complementarity are spread across the \\nincome distribution. When exposure is more equally distributed and complementarity is concentrated at the top, \\nAI adoption may raise income and wealth inequality. When exposure is concentrated at the top of the income \\ndistribution, and complementarity is weak, AI adoption could lead to a decline in income inequality. \\n \\n \\n \\nAnnex Figure 4.1.

AI Preparedness Index \\nV.1 Indicators \\nOne of the main contributions of this note is the construction of an index—underpinning the analysis in Section \\nV—that assesses the level of AI \\npreparedness across countries. \\nMeasuring AI preparedness is \\nchallenging, including because the \\ninstitutional requirements for economy-\\nwide integration of AI are still uncertain. \\nHowever, the literature on historical \\nepisodes of technology adoption (see \\nKeller 2004; Chinn and Fairlie 2007; \\nNicoletti, Rueden, and Andrews 2020; \\nCirera, Comin, and Cruz 2022) has identified \\nkey determinants that are likely relevant \\nfor AI: digital infrastructure, human \\ncapital, technological innovation, and \\nlegal frameworks. These broad \\ndeterminants are supplemented with a \\nset of indicators expected to be important \\nfor smooth AI adoption. These include \\nsustained human capital investment, \\ninclusive STEM [science, technology, \\nengineering, and mathematics] expertise, \\nlabor and capital mobility within and \\nacross countries, and adaptability of legal \\nframeworks to new (digital) business \\nmodels. The full set of indicators is \\nsummarized in Annex Table 5.1.  \\n \\nThe resulting index improves on common AI readiness indicators in the literature (for example, Oxford Insights \\n2022) on at least two fronts. First, the focus is on AI adoption preparedness (rather than invention leadership), \\nallowing comparability of the level of preparedness across all economies, including low-income countries \\n(where the focus will be more on adopting than inventing new technologies). Second, the index also crucially \\nincorporates labor market transition indicators relevant for the AI era, including active labor market (for \\nexample, upskilling and skills training) and social protection. Digital infrastructure and human capital and labor \\nmarket policies can be considered \"foundational” elements of AI preparedness, because they are prerequisites \\nfor its adoption. Innovation and economic integration and regulation and ethics can be considered “second-\\ngeneration” elements likely to maximize the economic impact of AI. \\nAnnex Table 5.1.

The AI Preparedness \\nIndex is then derived as the simple average of the \\nfour aggregate dimensions. The index is computed \\nfor 32 advanced economies, 56 emerging market \\neconomies, and 37 low-income countries. Annex \\nFigure 5.1 summarizes the level of AI \\npreparedness and its main components for \\nselected economies.  \\n \\nSection V shows that the index’s components are \\ncorrelated with information and communications \\ntechnology employment, corroborating their \\nrelevance. In addition, the strength of these \\ncorrelations conditional on development levels \\nmakes intuitive sense. \\n \\nEmploying simple averages in aggregating the \\nindex has at least two shortcomings.20 First, the \\nequal weighting inherently risks undervaluing key \\ncomponents and overemphasizing minor ones, \\nobscuring vital weaknesses or strengths, by \\nspreading their impact across the aggregate index. Second, the use of simple averages is sensitive to outliers \\nand extreme values.  \\n \\nAs a robustness check, we employ principal component analysis (PCA) in aggregating the index.  For each \\naggregate dimension, the first principal component (PC) of subindicators is extracted, normalized between 0 \\nand 1, and the index is then computed as the sum of these normalized PCs. The results based on the PCA are \\nindistinguishable from those obtained with simple averaging. \\n    \\n20 Other aggregation methods have their own strengths, but they also come with drawbacks in this context. For example, a constant \\nelasticity of substitution (CES) aggregation, which would assume imperfect substitutability among the index’s components, could \\nsuggest that a deficit in regulatory frameworks could be imperfectly substituted by, say, strong performance in innovation.  \\nAnnex Figure 5.1.

Advanced economies will experience the benefits and pitfalls of AI sooner than emerging \\nmarket and developing economies, largely because their employment structure is focused on cognitive-\\nintensive roles. There are some consistent patterns concerning AI exposure: women and college-educated \\nindividuals are more exposed but also better poised to reap AI benefits, and older workers are potentially less \\nable to adapt to the new technology. Labor income inequality may increase if the complementarity between AI \\nand high-income workers is strong, and capital returns will increase wealth inequality. However, if productivity \\ngains are sufficiently large, income levels could surge for most workers. In this evolving landscape, advanced \\neconomies and more developed emerging market economies need to focus on upgrading regulatory \\nframeworks and supporting labor reallocation while safeguarding those adversely affected. Emerging market \\nand developing economies should prioritize the development of digital infrastructure and digital skills.  \\n \\nRECOMMENDED CITATION: Cazzaniga and others. 2024. “Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and  the Future of \\nWork.” IMF Staff Discussion Note SDN2024/001, International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC.  \\nISBN: 979-8-40026-254-8  \\nJEL Classification Numbers:  E24, J24, J31, O33, O38 \\nKeywords: \\nArtificial Intelligence, Labor Market, Job Displacement, Income \\nInequality, Advanced Economies, Emerging Market Economies, Low-\\nIncome Developing Countries \\nAuthor’s E-Mail Address:  \\nmauro98cazzaniga@gmail.com, FJaumotte@imf.org, LLi4@imf.org, \\nGMelina@imf.org, APanton@imf.org, CPizzinelli@imf.org, \\nERockall@stanford.edu, MMendestavares@imf.org    \\n    \\n* The authors thank Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas and Antonio Spilimbergo for feedback and guidance and many IMF colleagues for \\nuseful comments.

Its consequences for economies and societies remain hard \\nto foresee. This is especially evident in the context of labor markets, where AI promises to increase productivity \\nwhile threatening to replace humans in some jobs and to complement them in others. \\n \\nAlmost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to AI, with advanced economies at greater risk but \\nalso better poised to exploit AI benefits than emerging market and developing economies. In advanced \\neconomies, about 60 percent of jobs are exposed to AI, due to prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. A \\nnew measure of potential AI complementarity suggests that, of these, about half may be negatively affected by \\nAI, while the rest could benefit from enhanced productivity through AI integration. Overall exposure is 40 \\npercent in emerging market economies and 26 percent in low-income countries. Although many emerging \\nmarket and developing economies may experience less immediate AI-related disruptions, they are also less \\nready to seize AI’s advantages. This could exacerbate the digital divide and cross-country income disparity.  \\n \\nAI will affect income and wealth inequality. Unlike previous waves of automation, which had the strongest \\neffect on middle-skilled workers, AI displacement risks extend to higher-wage earners. However, potential AI \\ncomplementarity is positively correlated with income. Hence, the effect on labor income inequality depends \\nlargely on the extent to which AI displaces or complements high-income workers. Model simulations suggest \\nthat, with high complementarity, higher-wage earners can expect a more-than-proportional increase in their \\nlabor income, leading to an increase in labor income inequality. This would amplify the increase in income and \\nwealth inequality that results from enhanced capital returns that accrue to high earners. Countries’ choices \\nregarding the definition of AI property rights, as well as redistributive and other fiscal policies, will ultimately \\nshape its impact on income and wealth distribution.  \\n \\nThe gains in productivity, if strong, could result in higher growth and higher incomes for most workers. \\nOwing to capital deepening and a productivity surge, AI adoption is expected to boost total income. If AI \\nstrongly complements human labor in certain occupations and the productivity gains are sufficiently large, \\nhigher growth and labor demand could more than compensate for the partial replacement of labor tasks by AI, \\nand incomes could increase along most of the income distribution.    \\n \\nCollege-educated workers are better prepared to move from jobs at risk of displacement to high-\\ncomplementarity jobs; older workers may be more vulnerable to the AI-driven transformation. In the UK \\nand Brazil, for instance, college-educated individuals historically moved more easily from jobs now assessed to \\nhave high displacement potential to those with high complementarity. In contrast, workers without \\npostsecondary education show reduced mobility. Younger workers who are adaptable and familiar with new \\ntechnologies may also be better able to leverage the new opportunities. In contrast, older workers may struggle \\nwith reemployment, adapting to technology, mobility, and training for new job skills. \\n \\nTo harness AI's potential fully, priorities depend on countries’ development levels.

Introduction \\nArtificial intelligence (AI) promises to boost productivity and growth, but its impact on economies and \\nsocieties is uncertain, varying by job roles and sectors, with the potential to amplify disparities. As a \\npositive productivity shock, AI will expand economies’ production frontiers and will lead to reallocations \\nbetween labor and capital while triggering potentially profound changes in many jobs and sectors. AI offers \\nunprecedented opportunities for solving complex problems and improving the accuracy of predictions, \\nenhancing decision-making, boosting economic growth, and improving lives. However, precisely because of its \\nvast and flexible applicability in numerous domains, the implications for economies and societies are uncertain \\n(Ilzetzki and Jain 2023). \\n \\nAI represents a wide spectrum of technologies designed to enable machines to perceive, interpret, act, \\nand learn with the intent to emulate human cognitive abilities. Across this spectrum, generative AI (GenAI) \\nincludes systems such as sophisticated large language models that can create new content, ranging from text \\nto images, by learning from extensive training data. Other AI models, in contrast, are more specialized, \\nfocusing on discrete tasks such as pattern identification. Meanwhile, automation is characterized by its focus on \\noptimizing repetitive tasks to boost productivity, rather than producing new content. The field of AI is \\nexperiencing a swift evolution, especially with the advent of GenAI, which has broadened AI's potential \\napplications. This suggests that its impact will expand to reshape job functions and the division of labor. \\n \\nOne critical dimension to consider is the societal acceptability of AI. Acceptability may vary depending on \\njob roles. Some professions may seamlessly integrate AI tools, while others could face resistance because of \\ncultural, ethical, or operational concerns. This uncertainty becomes especially pronounced in labor markets. \\nAlthough AI holds the potential for production-oriented applications, its effect will likely be mixed. In some \\nsectors where human oversight of AI is necessary, it could amplify worker productivity and labor demand. \\nConversely, in other sectors, AI might pave the way for significant job displacements. A rise in aggregate \\nproductivity of the economy could however strengthen overall economic demand, potentially creating more job \\nopportunities for most workers in a ripple effect. Moreover, this evolution could also lead to the emergence of \\nnew sectors and job roles—and the disappearance of others—transcending mere intersectoral reallocation. \\n \\nBeyond immediate job effects, another critical economic dimension is the capital income channel. As AI \\ndrives efficiency and innovations, those who own AI technologies or have stakes in AI-driven industries may \\nexperience increased capital income. This shift could potentially exacerbate inequalities. \\n \\nAI challenges the belief that technology affects mainly middle and, in some cases, low-skill jobs: its \\nadvanced algorithms can now augment or replace high-skill roles previously thought immune to \\nautomation. While historical waves of automation and the integration of information technology affected \\npredominantly routine tasks, AI's capabilities extend to cognitive functions, enabling it to process vast amounts \\nof data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. As a result, even high-skill occupations, which were \\npreviously considered immune to automation because of their complexity and reliance on deep expertise now \\nface potential disruption.1 Jobs that require nuanced judgment, creative problem-solving, or intricate data \\n    \\n1 Another historical example of technology that hit the relatively educated is the introduction of the calculator.

This \\nshift challenges the conventional wisdom that technological advances threaten primarily lower-skill jobs and \\npoints to a broader and deeper transformation of the labor market than by previous technological revolutions. \\n \\nThe impact of AI is also likely to differ significantly across countries at different levels of development \\nor with different economic structures. Advanced economies, with their mature industries and service-driven \\neconomies, typically have a higher concentration of jobs in sectors that require complex cognitive tasks. These \\neconomies are therefore both more susceptible to, yet better positioned to benefit from, AI innovations. \\nConversely, emerging market and developing economies, often still reliant on manual labor and traditional \\nindustries, may initially face fewer AI-induced disruptions. However, these economies may also miss out on \\nearly AI-driven productivity gains, given their lack of infrastructure and a skilled workforce. Over time, the AI \\ndivide could exacerbate existing economic disparities, with advanced economies harnessing AI for competitive \\nadvantage while emerging market and developing economies grapple with integrating AI into their growth \\nmodels. \\n \\nTo inform the discussion on the potential impact of AI on the future of work and which policies \\ncountries should enact in response, this note aims to answer six questions. \\n \\n(1) Which countries are more exposed to AI adoption? Which countries are likely to benefit most? \\n(2) How differently will AI affect workers within countries? Which segments of workers are likely to thrive \\nand which face more risks?  \\n(3) Historically, how frequently did workers shift between roles now facing varying AI exposure? What \\ninsights do these shifts reveal about labor adaptability? \\n(4) In what ways could AI reshape income and wealth inequality?  \\n(5) What is the potential impact for growth and productivity?  \\n(6) Which countries appear better prepared for the AI transition? How can policies maximize gains and \\nmitigate likely AI-related challenges? \\n \\nThis note builds on a growing body of work that explores the impact of AI on labor markets and the \\nmacroeconomy. Many empirical studies so far have focused largely on the US, finding that many of the tasks \\nof a significant portion of the workforce, including those of high-skilled workers, could be substantially replaced \\nby AI (for example, Felten, Raj, and Seamans 2021, 2023; Eloundou and others 2023; Webb 2020). A few \\nstudies (OECD 2023; Albanesi and others 2023; Briggs and Kodnani 2023) adopt a cross-country approach; \\nGmyrek, Berg, and Bescond (2023) undertake a comprehensive review of emerging market economies and \\nfind less exposure to AI than in advanced economies; Colombo, Mercorio, and Mezzanzanica (2019) focus on \\nthe Italian labor market. These studies apply empirical approaches similar to those used in the automation \\nliterature (for example, Autor and Dorn 2013, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2022, Das and Hilgenstock 2022).  \\n \\nThis note contributes to the existing literature in four significant ways. First, while previous AI exposure \\nmeasures often implicitly equate exposure with substitutability of human tasks, this note attempts to assess the \\npotential for complementarity and substitution with labor, using the approach developed by Pizzinelli and others \\n(2023). This method considers the wider social, ethical, and physical context of occupations, along with \\nrequired skill levels, to discern whether AI may complement or replace roles. This adds to recent studies that \\nhave attempted to make this distinction using a purely task-based framework (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018,',\n",

Third, it takes a deep \\nlook at how AI may affect income and wealth inequality within countries. It dissects AI exposure patterns across \\ndemographics and earnings levels and uses a model-based analysis to evaluate AI's impact on labor and \\ncapital income inequality, as well as on income levels. Last, the note examines how AI preparedness for this \\ntechnological shift may differ across countries at different income levels, using a very large sample of advanced \\nand emerging market and developing economies.  \\n \\nWith this analysis there are some important caveats. First, although in the model analysis activity grows in \\noccupations with high AI complementarity and falls in low-complementarity occupations—mimicking sectoral \\nreallocations—the analysis on AI exposure assumes that sector sizes are fixed and that the tasks required in \\neach occupation are unchanged. Consequently, the results are more pertinent for the short to medium term. \\nOver longer horizons, workers will likely migrate across different sectors and roles, or acquire new skills, and \\njobs will evolve. In addition, the analysis assumes that workers within the same occupation will be affected in \\nthe same way, but there can be variation in the effects of AI. AI may also affect firm dynamics and market \\nconcentration (Babina and others, forthcoming), driving inequality between workers at different firms. Second, \\nthe study relies on the premise that tasks performed within similar occupations are homogenous around the \\nworld, while there can be significant cross-country variations. Third, the approach abstracts from linkages \\nacross occupations and countries (trade linkages), as well as from cross-border spillovers of AI exposure. Last, \\nwhile the analyses on workers’ AI exposure and societies’ preparedness use empirical approaches, the \\npotential impacts on inequality and productivity are analyzed with a model. The latter therefore depend on \\npotentially strong calibration assumptions. The pace of AI adoption, influenced by the time needed by firms to \\ninvest in any necessary physical capital and the reorganization required to capitalize on AI, is difficult to \\nforesee. Likewise, the time required to exert aggregate macroeconomic effects, the impact on intersectoral \\nreallocation of factors for production, the birth of new industries, and AI’s exact implications for economies and \\nsocieties are challenging to predict. Any estimate embodies a level of uncertainty reminiscent of past \\nintroductions of general-purpose technologies, such as electricity. This uncertainty applies also to the results of \\nthis note. \\n \\nThe remainder of the note is structured as follows. Section II illustrates the conceptual framework of AI \\nexposure and complementarity and attempts to quantify empirically the degree of exposure to and \\ncomplementarity with AI across countries and groups of workers within countries. Section III examines how \\neasily workers have historically shifted across roles now facing varying degrees of AI exposure and \\ncomplementarity. Section IV uses a model to project potential implications of AI adoption for productivity, \\nincomes, and inequality. Section V assesses countries’ AI preparedness in key policy areas. Section VI \\nconcludes and presents policy considerations.   \\n \\nII. AI Exposure and Complementarity  \\nII.1 Conceptual Framework \\n \\nAssessing the impact of AI on employment is complex because of its swift evolution, uncertainty in \\nintegration across production processes, and shifting societal perceptions. Given the rapid advance and \\nevolving capabilities of AI-based technologies, which production processes will integrate AI and which human\",\n",

Over time, the changing social acceptability of AI could \\nalso affect its integration into production processes. \\n \\nThis note refines a commonly used conceptual framework to better measure human work’s exposure \\nto, and complementarity with, AI. To study the effect of technological innovation on jobs, it is standard to \\nconceptualize individual occupations as a bundle of tasks and to consider which tasks can be replaced or \\ncomplemented by technology (see for instance Acemoglu and Restrepo 2022; and Moll, Rachel, and Restrepo \\n2022 for recent applications). Felten, Raj, and Seamans (2021, 2023) define “exposure” to AI as the degree of \\noverlap between AI applications and required human abilities in each occupation. The analysis refines this \\napproach by augmenting it with Pizzinelli and others’ (2023) index of potential AI complementarity. This index \\nleverages information on the social, ethical, and physical context of occupations, along with required skill levels \\n(see Box 1 for details). The index reflects an occupation’s likely degree of shielding from AI-driven job \\ndisplacement and, when paired with high AI exposure, gives an indication of AI complementarity potential. For \\nexample, because of advances in textual analysis, judges are highly exposed to AI, but they are also highly \\nshielded from displacement because society is currently unlikely to delegate judicial rulings to unsupervised AI. \\nConsequently, AI will likely complement judges, increasing their productivity rather than replacing them.2 \\nConversely, clerical workers, who are also very exposed to AI but have a lower level of shielding, are more at \\nrisk of being displaced. The level of shielding and complementarity will likely evolve over time and at a different \\npace across countries, reflecting higher AI accuracy, which will decrease the chances for “hallucinations”—AI \\nsystem output that is not based on reality or a given context. Social preferences and available alternatives will \\nalso play a role (see Pizzinelli and others 2023 for quantitative illustrations of this phenomenon). For example, \\nin low-income countries, where trained doctors are scarce, scalable AI-backed medical consultations may be \\nviewed as an attractive option. The remainder of this note refers to the complementarity potential driven by high \\nAI exposure and high shielding more succinctly as “complementarity.” \\n \\nJoint consideration of exposure and complementarity indicates the types of labor market \\ndevelopments each occupation is more likely to experience with AI adoption. Occupations with high \\nexposure for which AI can autonomously complete tasks may see reduced human labor demand, leading to \\nlower wages. Jobs that require human supervision over AI may experience a boost in productivity, which would \\nraise labor demand and wages for incumbent workers. However, even in occupations in which AI is likely to \\ncomplement human labor, workers without AI-related skills risk reduced employment. Hence, the ease of \\nacquiring AI-related skills will determine the ultimate impact of this technology.   \\n \\nBased on these two criteria, occupations can be categorized into three groups: “high exposure, high \\ncomplementarity”; “high exposure, low complementarity”; and “low exposure” (see Box 1).3 Although \\nthe indicators (and the thresholds adopted to define what is high and low, represented by their median values) \\nare relative measures, this categorization highlights the overarching differences across occupations in terms of \\ntheir AI exposure and complementarity potential. High-exposure, high-complementarity occupations have \\nsignificant potential for AI support, as AI can complement workers in their tasks and decision-making. However,',\n",

Hence, for the sake of simplicity, this \\nnote groups occupations with low exposure together regardless of their potential complementarity.',\n",

In such roles, workers can potentially reap the productivity benefits from AI, provided they have the \\nskills needed to interact with the technology. On the other hand, high-exposure, low-complementarity \\noccupations are well positioned for AI integration, but there is a greater likelihood that AI will replace human \\ntasks. This could lead to a decline in labor demand and slower wage growth for these jobs. Telemarketers are \\na prime example. Last, low-exposure occupations” have minimal or no potential for AI application. This group \\nencompasses a diverse range of professions, from dishwashers and performers to others. \\n \\nThis conceptual framework is subject to several caveats. First, the index of Felten, Raj, and Seamans \\n(2021) and the complementarity measure discussed in Box 1 offer only a relative interpretation. In other words, \\nthese measures tell us whether a given occupation is more or less exposed, or complementary, than others. \\nSecond, high complementarity can still result in displacement from occupations of workers who do not have the \\nrequired skills or whose employers do not invest in the technology. Companies investing in these technologies \\nearlier would solidify commercial advantages over competitors. In other words, while the analysis assumes that \\nworkers within the same occupation will be affected in the same way, there can be variation in the effects of AI. \\nFirms that are more successful at integrating AI may increase their productivity more than competitors and pay \\nhigher wages, exacerbating intra-occupational inequality. Third, the conceptual framework provides only a \\nstatic view of exposure and complementarity. In this regard, it does not speak to the existing or prospective \\navailability of necessary IT infrastructure or to workers’ ability to acquire the needed skills or to relocate across \\ndifferent occupations. Neither does it take into account the effects of ongoing integration of AI and robotics. In \\naddition, it does not factor in potential changes in societal preferences, which will also shape regulations and \\ncould make unsupervised AI acceptable in a growing number of contexts or ban its use in others. On the \\nmacroeconomic side, it does not account for adoption speed and the factors influencing adoption, including \\ncosts borne by firms compared with productivity benefits. The conceptual framework also does not factor in \\nfeedback effects, which, for example—through higher overall productivity as a result of AI adoption—could \\nboost labor demand for most types of jobs, partially offsetting potential negative impacts of AI.  \\n \\nThe note applies this categorization to appraise the exposure of the current employment structure to AI \\nfor a large number of countries. The definitions are applied to 142 countries using the online International \\nLabour Organization (ILO) employment database and an internationally consistent classification of occupations. \\nTo examine within-country variation, a more granular level of the categorization—based on more than 400 \\noccupation titles—is also applied to countries with good microdata coverage: two advanced economies (UK \\nand US) and four emerging market economies (Brazil, Colombia, India, South Africa).4  \\nII.2 Cross-Country Differences \\n \\nAbout 40 percent of workers worldwide are in high-exposure occupations; the share is 60 percent in \\nadvanced economies, which indicates potentially large macroeconomic implications.

Share of employment within each country group is calculated as the \\nworking-age-population-weighted average. \\n \\nThe composition of the labor force in terms of broad occupational groups reflecting countries’ \\neconomic structure explains most of the differences in exposure and complementarity across \\ncountries. Figure 2 reports the employment shares by occupational groups for three countries with markedly \\ndifferent shares of employment in exposed occupations.

Given their high shares of employment in both low- and high-complementarity occupations, \\nadvanced economies may experience a more polarized effect from the structural transformation brought about \\nby AI. On one hand, they face a greater risk of labor displacement and harmful income developments for \\nworkers in the high-exposure and low-complementarity occupations. On the other hand, they are better \\npositioned to take advantage early of the emerging AI growth opportunities as a result of their larger amount of \\nemployment in high-exposure and high-complementarity jobs. The net employment impact will depend on \\ncountries’ ability to innovate, adopt, and adapt to AI. Both advanced and emerging market and developing \\neconomies are subject to considerable uncertainty surrounding these predictions. For example, in low-income \\ncountries AI adoption could mirror the swift adoption of mobile technology and lead to large marginal benefits \\nfrom AI. In addition, with the appropriate digital infrastructure in place, AI may also represent an opportunity for \\nemerging market and developing economies to address skill shortages, especially in the health and education \\nsectors, potentially increasing inclusion and productivity (Box 2). \\nII.3 Within-Country Differences \\n \\nBeyond the overall exposure of each country to AI, different groups within countries are likely to be \\naffected differently. The advent of AI could exacerbate inequality within countries along various dimensions, \\nsuch as the income level of individuals, their education level, or their gender. Understanding which groups are \\nmost vulnerable is essential to design policies that can mitigate those effects. Interestingly, while the overall \\nexposure of countries to AI differs significantly between advanced and emerging market and developing \\neconomies, the patterns of exposure across individuals within countries are very similar for the two advanced \\neconomies and the four emerging market economies included in the granular microdata analysis. An important \\ncaveat is that findings may be different in other countries.  \\n \\nExposure is higher for women and for more educated workers but is mitigated by a higher potential for \\ncomplementarity with AI (Figure 3). In most countries, women tend to be employed in high-exposure \\noccupations more than men (Figure 3, panel 1). Because this share is distributed approximately equally',\n",
              " 'STAFF DISCUSSION NOTES Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work \\n \\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 10 \\n \\nbetween low- and high-complementarity jobs, the result can be interpreted to mean that women face both \\ngreater risks and greater opportunities. Exceptions to this pattern may be attributed to high shares of women in \\nagricultural jobs, especially in countries where the farming sector is large (for example, India). Turning to \\neducation, in all countries examined, higher education levels are associated with a greater share of \\nemployment in high-exposure occupations, but this is especially pronounced in occupations with high \\ncomplementarity (Figure 3, panel 2). The higher level of exposure supports the popular view that, unlike \\nautomation, AI could more strongly affect high-skilled workers. However, higher exposure is alleviated by \\ngreater potential for complementarity. Last, age differences do not exhibit a common pattern (Figure 3, panel \\n3). This is because the composition of different age cohorts in terms of gender and education is very distinct \\nacross countries, thus overshadowing age-based differences. In the UK and the US, younger groups have \\nmore college-educated individuals thanks to increased university attendance over the past 30 years; gender \\ncomposition of age groups is similar. In emerging market economies and low-income countries, there are fewer \\npeople with higher education, but younger groups have more women thanks to recent rises in female labor \\nparticipation. \\n \\nFigure 3. Share of Employment in High-Exposure Occupations by Demographic Groups \\n1. By Gender \\n(Percent) \\n2. By Education \\n(Percent) \\n3.

In panel 1, employment shares are conditional on each gender \\ncategory. In panel 2, employment shares are conditional on each of the four education categories ( middle school and below, high school, some \\ncollege, college or higher). In panel 3, employment shares are conditional on each of the four age intervals. Country labels use International \\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) country codes. \\n \\nExposure is spread along the labor income distribution, but potential gains from AI are positively \\ncorrelated with income. The share of employment in occupations at risk of displacement (high-exposure, low-\\ncomplementarity jobs; Figure 4, panel 1) is broadly similar across income quantiles (with a mildly positive slope \\nin emerging market economies). This differs from previous waves of automation and information technology \\nduring which risks of displacement were highest for middle-income earners. Consistent with popular discourse, \\nAI differs from traditional automation by potentially affecting jobs of workers throughout the income distribution. \\nHowever, employment in occupations that have a high potential for complementarity with AI (high-exposure, \\nhigh-complementarity jobs; Figure 4, panel 2) is more concentrated in the upper-income quantiles. The \\ncorrelation between earnings and potential complementarity is consistent with the findings on education level \\nand is even more pronounced for emerging market economies (Figure 4, panel 3). This suggests that AI’s \\ngains will likely disproportionately accrue to higher-income earners, especially in countries such as India and, to \\na lesser extent, the US, where complementarity steadily rises at the top of the distribution. The phenomenon \\nwill likely be more muted in countries such as the UK, where the increase in complementarity plateaus at the \\ntop.',\n",

Over time, \\nhowever, workers are likely to adapt to the evolving labor market. Although the analysis on AI exposure and \\ncomplementarity is conducted at the occupational level, it is important to make a distinction between jobs and \\nworkers. AI adoption may destroy some jobs (and displace the associated workers) and create or enhance \\nothers—but whether the incumbents are the ones who can reap the associated benefits is unclear. The \\nemployment effects will likely depend on worker characteristics, which in turn will affect their adaptability. \\nHistorical data suggest that some workers may struggle to adapt to technology-induced shifts in the job \\nmarket.6  \\n \\nHistorical job transition patterns suggest how workers could adapt. This section analyzes microdata from \\nBrazil and the UK to examine worker transition across occupations with different current AI exposure and \\n    \\n6 In the US, Cortes, Jaimovich and Siu (2017) found that less-educated young men contributed to the decline in routine manual jobs \\nsince the 1980s, while women with intermediate education led the fall in routine cognitive jobs. These workers often moved to low-\\nwage occupations or nonemployment. Most of the reallocation took place through fewer moves into these occupations from \\nunemployment and inactivity (Cortes and others 2020), suggesting that automation affected job seekers more than current workers. \\nIn the UK, Dabla-Norris, Pizzinelli, and Rappaport (2023) found that routine job decline affected women without college degrees \\ndifferently across ages: older women shifted to higher-paying jobs, while younger ones went to lower-paying manual jobs.',\n",

In general, workers switch between similar types of occupations, indicating potentially limited \\nflexibility in adjusting to evolving labor markets.

Analyzing these dynamics can provide suggestive evidence \\non possible worker movements following AI adoption and help identify potentially vulnerable groups.  \\n \\nFigure 5.

The share of transitions represents the average share of transitions in the “from”  category for college-\\neducated workers who go to the “to” category. \\n \\nWorkers with a college education have historically shown a greater ability to transition into what are \\nnow jobs with high AI-complementarity potential. Both college- and non-college-educated workers \\nfrequently change occupations. The average yearly occupation-switching probability is 43.7 percent in Brazil \\nand 29.8 percent in the UK for college-educated workers and 38 percent and 27 percent for non-college-\\neducated workers.9 College-educated individuals working in what are or may become AI-intensive jobs tend to \\nstay within such environments when they switch jobs, irrespective of AI’s complementarity to their roles (Figure \\n5). In addition, more than a third of those moving away from low-complementarity jobs shift toward roles with \\nhigher AI complementarity, which demonstrates a potential avenue for job growth. Non-college-educated \\nworkers are predominantly found in low-AI-exposure jobs and are less inclined to move to high-\\ncomplementarity positions when they switch from high-exposure, low-complementarity occupations.10 \\n \\n    \\n7 Annex 3 provides details on the data used for the analysis, and Cazzaniga and others (forthcoming) describe the methodology \\nand perform further analysis. The analysis in this section is conducted only for the UK and Brazil because the labor force surveys for \\nthese two countries are structured as rotating panels, which allows for tracking individual workers over time. The analysis, however, \\ncomes with a caveat: cohort effects are not included because of the limited time series dimension of the data. \\n8 Gender is not directly discussed in this section because the main results presented below for each education group hold for both \\nmales and females separately.  \\n9 These values are broadly in line with other evidence on occupational mobility in advanced economies and emerging markets. For \\ninstance, for the US, Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) estimate a yearly occupation switching rate of 21 percent, while Moscarini \\nand Vella (2008) estimate a monthly rate of 3.5 percent, equivalent to 34.7 percent annually. Meanwhile, for Brazil, Monsueto, \\nMoreira Cunha, and da Silva Bichara (2014) estimate a 30 percent occupation switching rate over a period of four months. \\n10 Industry switches also happen, but the classification of AI exposure and complementarity has not been conducted at the industry \\nlevel. While some occupations are industry-specific (for example, doctors typically work in health care), others are more versatile \\nand can cross into other industries.',\n",

Figure 6 shows that college-educated workers often transition from low- to high-complementarity jobs \\nin their 20s and 30s. Their career progression stabilizes by their late 30s to early 50s, when they usually have \\nreached senior roles and are less inclined to make significant job switches. Although non-college-educated \\nworkers show similar patterns, their progression is less pronounced, and they occupy fewer high-exposure \\npositions. This suggests that young, educated workers are exposed to both potential labor market disruptions \\nand opportunities in occupations likely to be affected by AI. On one hand, if low-complementarity positions, \\nsuch as clerical jobs, serve as stepping stones toward high-complementarity jobs, a reduction in the demand \\nfor low-complementarity occupations could make young high-skilled workers’ entry into the labor market more \\ndifficult. On the other hand, AI may enable young college-educated workers to become experienced more \\nquickly as they leverage their familiarity with new technologies to enhance their productivity. With the \\nintroduction of generative AI, the use of AI has itself become much easier. A recent study shows that the \\nproductivity impact of an AI-based conversational assistant was greatest for less experienced and low-skilled \\ncustomer support workers; the effect on experienced and highly skilled workers was minimal (Brynjolfsson, \\nDanielle, and Raymond 2023). \\n \\nOlder workers may be less adaptable and face additional barriers to mobility, as reflected in their lower \\nlikelihood of reemployment after termination. Following job termination, older workers are less likely to \\nsecure new employment within a year than young and prime-age workers (Figure 7). Several factors can \\nexplain this discrepancy. First, older workers’ skills, though once in high demand, may now be obsolete as a \\nresult of rapid technological advances. Moreover, after significant time in a particular location, they may have \\ngeographic and emotional ties, such as to a spouse and children, that discourage them from relocation for new \\njob opportunities. Financial obligations accumulated over the years might also make them less likely to accept \\npositions with a pay cut. Last, having invested many years, if not decades, in a particular sector or occupation, \\nthere may be a natural reluctance or even a perceptual barrier to a transition to entirely new roles or industries. \\nThis may reflect a combination of comfort with familiar settings, concern about the learning curve in a new \\ndomain, or perceived age bias. These constraints are likely to be relevant also in the context of AI-induced \\ndisruptions.',\n",

After unemployment, older \\nworkers previously employed in high-exposure and high-complementarity occupations are less likely to find \\njobs in the same category of occupation than prime-age workers (Figure 7). This difference in the \\nreemployment dynamics can reflect technological change, changes in workers’ preferences, and age-related \\nbiases or stereotypes in the hiring processes in high-complementarity and high-exposure occupations. \\nTechnological change may affect older workers through the need to learn new skills. Firms may not find it \\nbeneficial to invest in teaching new skills to workers with a shorter career horizon; older workers may also be \\nless likely to engage in such training, since the perceived benefit may be limited given the limited remaining \\nyears of employment. This effect can be magnified by the generosity of pension and unemployment insurance \\nprograms.11 These channels align with Braxton and Taska (2023), which finds that technology contributes 45 \\npercent of earnings losses following unemployment. This happens primarily because workers lacking new skills \\nmove to jobs where their existing skills are valued but that garner lower wages. \\n \\nOccupational switches also affect workers’ incomes. In both the Brazil and the UK, progressing to high-\\nexposure, high-complementarity occupations is associated with higher wages (Figure 8).12 Greater access to \\nthese types of jobs could thus be an significant driver of income growth for workers in advanced and emerging \\nmarket and developing economies.

AI, Productivity, and Inequality \\nIn this section, a model-based analysis is used to evaluate the potential impact of AI adoption on the \\neconomy and inequality. This analytical approach serves as a complement to the preceding empirical \\nfindings by examining broader effects on the economy, highlighting three critical channels through which AI \\nmay affect it: (1) labor displacement, (2) complementarity, and (3) productivity gains. These three channels are \\nessential to gauging the potential impact of AI adoption. First, AI adoption may shift tasks previously performed \\nby labor to AI capital, leading to a reduction in labor income. Second, AI adoption may increase the importance \\nof tasks that are not displaced by AI, particularly in occupations with high complementarity between human \\nlabor and AI. This leads to a shift in value added and labor demand toward occupations with high AI \\ncomplementarity and away from other occupations. Third, AI adoption may lead to broad-based productivity \\ngains, boosting investment and increasing overall labor demand, which may offset some of the decline in labor \\nincome caused by AI-induced labor displacement. As a result, the overall impact of AI on income levels and \\ninequality will depend on the extent to which gains in economic activity generated by AI-induced productivity \\ncompensate for any labor income losses.',\n",
              " \"STAFF DISCUSSION NOTES Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work \\n \\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 16 \\n \\n \\nTo understand AI's impact on income levels and income inequality, both labor and capital income \\nchannels must be examined. A task-based model, detailed in Rockall, Pizzinelli, and Tavares (forthcoming), \\nis developed. The model builds on the work of Drozd, Taschereau-Dumouchel, and Tavares (2022) and Moll, \\nRachel, and Restrepo (2022). Agents differ by their labor productivity and asset holdings, offering a rich picture \\nof the income and wealth distribution. AI is assumed to be adopted at its maximum potential and affects agents \\naccording to their AI exposure and complementarity potential. Within this analytical framework, AI's effect on \\nincome operates primarily through the three channels mentioned above. AI adoption also leads to increases in \\nthe return on capital, raising capital income, which in turn increases wealth and wealth inequality consistently \\nwith the initial distribution of asset holdings. \\n \\nThe model is calibrated to the United Kingdom, a country that is highly exposed to AI adoption. \\nWorkers’ income is divided into three categories: (1) labor income, which can be positively or negatively \\nexposed to AI depending on its degree of complementarity with workers’ skills; (2) capital income, which \\nincreases with AI adoption; and (3) benefits and other income (government benefits, pensions, and so forth).13 \\nFigure 9, panel 1, shows that high-income workers have a much larger share of capital income than middle- \\nand low-income workers, suggesting that this source of income may play a crucial role in determining the \\nincome inequality impact of AI adoption. Middle- and low-income workers’ total income depends more on labor \\nincome. The impact of AI on labor income will vary with workers’ AI exposure and complementarity. In line with \\nthe evidence presented in Section II, Figure 9, panel 2, shows that workers’ exposure to AI increases with their \\nincome. However, workers’ potential complementarity with AI also increases with income, albeit in the case of \\nthe UK, it peaks around the 75th percentile, declining slightly thereafter.  \\n \\nThe impact of AI is simulated by building three scenarios, which assume a labor share decline in line \\nwith comparable historical episodes associated with automation. The decrease in the labor share has \\nhistorically been associated with routine-biased automation and, to a lesser extent, with increased trade, \\ngrowing markups, and declining worker bargaining power resulting from the weakening of labor unions.14 \\nDrawing on the change observed in the UK between 1980 and 2014 as a possible scenario, we assume that \\nthe labor share declines by 5.5 percentage points following the introduction of AI. This impact is spread across \\nthe income distribution, depending on workers’ AI exposure and complementarity, as shown in Figure 9, panel \\n2. The three scenarios embed the same displacement of labor tasks via the capital deepening effect but are  \\ndifferentiated by (1) low-complementarity, if AI only mildly increases the demand for high-complementarity \\noccupations; (2) high-complementarity, if AI strongly supports the demand for high-complementarity \\noccupations; and (3) high-complementarity and high productivity, if AI strongly complements high-\\ncomplementary occupations, as in scenario (2), and further augments the productivity of the economy, \\npredominantly through workers in high-complementarity occupations. The productivity increase is calibrated to \\ngenerate close to a 1.5 percentage point increase in the workers’ average annual productivity growth rate in the \\nfirst 10 years after AI adoption. This value is at the lower end of firm-level studies estimating the potential \\nimpact of AI adoption on workers’ productivity (as discussed in Briggs and Kodnani 2023).15\",\n",

In the panel, we plot AI exposure and complementarity by total income percentiles.  \\nRHS = right scale. \\n \\nThe impact of AI on labor income inequality depends on the race between the degree of exposure to, \\nand complementarity with, AI, and its boost to productivity.16 When AI has low complementarity with labor, \\nAI adoption leads to a decline in labor income inequality (Figure 10) because of the displacement effect. At the \\ntop of the income distribution the displacement effect is larger than the complementarity gains, leading to a \\nlabor income decline at the top. When AI is highly complementary to labor, the complementarity effect becomes \\nstronger than the displacement effect, particularly in the upper half of the income distribution, leading to a \\nsmaller share of high-income workers negatively affected by AI compared with the low-complementarity case. \\nThe share of workers negatively affected at the top drops from almost 15 percent to less than 5 percent. This \\nhigh complementarity also leads to a decline in the labor income of those with less complementary tasks, who \\nare typically among low-income workers. As a consequence, labor income inequality increases. Last, when the \\nAI productivity impact is also considered, labor income rises for all workers in the economy, even for the \\nworkers who have low exposure and those with high exposure and low complementarity. The main reason is \\nthat higher productivity leads to higher demand for all factors of production in the economy, leading to \\nincreased labor income. However, labor income inequality rises because the increase is larger for workers with \\nhigh AI complementarity. \\n \\nUnlike labor income inequality, capital income and wealth inequality always increase with AI adoption \\n(Figure 10). The main reason for the increase in capital income and wealth inequality is that AI leads to labor \\ndisplacement and an increase in the demand for AI capital, increasing capital returns and asset holdings' value. \\nIn all scenarios, interest rates increase by almost 0.4 percentage point, with the potential to partially offset the \\ndecline in the natural rate of interest in the UK and advanced economies in general.17 Since in the model, as in \\n    \\n16 Annex 4 discusses two additional hypothetical scenarios that disentangle the importance of exposure and complementarity.  \\n17 The increase in the interest rate is approximately of the same magnitude as the decline in the UK natural rate attributable to \\ndemographics (IMF 2023).\",\n",

These gains happen primarily in the first 10 years of the transition. Under this \\nthird scenario, despite the increase in labor income inequality, the total income level increases for all workers in \\nthe economy, ranging from 2 percent for low-income workers to almost 14 percent for high-income workers.  \\n \\nIn emerging market and developing economies with higher initial inequality, AI could amplify wealth \\ngaps and reduce wage disparity to a larger extent, but if the exposure to AI is lower and widespread, it \\ncould dampen these effects. An important issue is how model results may change when considering two \\naspects pertinent to emerging market and developing economies: (1) higher initial levels of income and wealth \\ninequality and (2) lower exposure to AI. Simulations suggest that higher initial income and wealth inequality \\ncould exacerbate wealth disparity, because AI-associated gains accrue predominantly to top earners. At the \\nsame time, labor income inequality could decrease to a larger extent because of a higher concentration of AI-\\nexposed workers at the top of the income distribution. The final effect, however, depends on the degree of \\ncomplementarity, as in the case of advanced economies. In an economy with fewer AI-exposed workers, the \\ndirect impact of AI on both income and wealth distribution may be less pronounced, given that fewer people \\nstand to benefit from AI.18 Last, AI’s potential to enhance public services, modernize finance, and bolster such \\nsectors as agriculture and health care could boost inclusion and productivity in emerging market and \\ndeveloping economies. Although these aspects are outside the scope of the model analysis, they are \\ndiscussed in Box 2. \\n \\nAlthough the model simulations focus on within-country inequality, AI adoption may also have \\nsignificant effects on global economic disparity, driven by potential reshoring of activities to advanced \\neconomies. Such a shift could trigger reallocation of capital and labor from less developed regions, which are \\nnot as prepared to harness AI, toward more technologically advanced and AI-ready countries (Alonso and \\nothers 2022). Call centers located in emerging market economies are a potential example. These could be at \\nrisk of replacement by AI-driven solutions, subsequently leading to their relocation to advanced economies. In \\naddition to labor reallocation, the increased profitability of firms that adopt AI may generate an influx of capital \\nfrom emerging market and developing economies to advanced economies, which could reduce equilibrium \\ninterest rates in advanced economies and exert downward pressure on capital income.19 Clearly, these \\ndynamics are highly uncertain at this stage. It is also possible that, with sufficient investment, AI may help \\nemerging market and developing economies leapfrog in certain sectors, facilitating the offshoring of a broader \\nselection of tasks and thus reducing cross-country inequality. \\n \\nV.

Therefore, the human capital and labor market policies element, which incorporates the presence \\nof social safety nets, assesses the prevalence and inclusive distribution of digital skills within the labor force \\nand the presence of policies that facilitate labor reallocation while safeguarding those harmed by AI-induced \\ntransitions (Nicoletti, Rueden, and Andrews 2020). Coupled with strong infrastructure, a digitally skilled labor \\nforce is vital for innovation and economic integration (Autor, Levy, and Murnane 2003), which not only fosters \\ndomestic technological development through a vibrant R&D ecosystem but also promotes international trade \\nand attracts foreign investment and new (AI) technologies (Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen 2015). Last, the \\nregulation and ethics dimension evaluates the extent to which the existing legal frameworks are adaptable to \\nevolving new (digital) business models and the \\npresence of strong governance for effective \\nenforcement.  \\n \\nWealthier economies, including advanced and \\nsome emerging market economies, are generally \\nbetter prepared than low-income countries to \\nadopt AI, although there is considerable variation \\nacross countries (Figure 12). Broadly, advanced \\nand some emerging market economies are highly \\nexposed to potential disruptions from AI—amid a \\nsubstantial share of employment in highly exposed \\noccupations. Yet these highly exposed economies, \\nnotably the UK and US, as analyzed in Section II, are \\nalso well positioned to harness the benefits and \\nmitigate the risks of AI thanks to their strong \\npreparedness, particularly in digital infrastructure, \\nhuman capital, and adaptable regulatory frameworks. \\nOn the other hand, low-income countries, although \\nrelatively less exposed, are underprepared across all \\ndimensions to harness the benefits of AI. Notably, \\nweak digital infrastructure and a less digitally skilled \\nlabor force are a concern. These  \\nFigure 12.

In this context, it is useful to distinguish \\nbetween foundational AI preparedness—digital infrastructure and human capital that enable workers and firms \\nto adopt AI—and second-generation preparedness (innovation and legal frameworks). For economies with high \\nAI exposure and strong foundational AI adoption preparedness (advanced economies and some emerging \\nmarket economies), more emphasis should be placed on strengthening their digital innovation capacity and \\nadapting their legal and ethical frameworks to govern and foster AI advances. Accordingly, improvement in \\nregulatory frameworks—which are critical for broadening societal trust in AI tools—followed by innovation and \\nintegration, are the AI preparedness dimensions more strongly correlated with the size of the digital sector in \\nadvanced economies (Figure 13, panels 3 and 4). Regulatory frameworks need to mitigate cybersecurity risks \\nas well (Carriere-Swallow and Haksar 2019; Haksar and others 2021), which increase with widespread use of \\nAI (Bank of America 2023) and may adversely affect firms’ performance (Jamilov, Rey, and Tahoun 2023). \\nWhere foundational preparedness is weak (low-income countries and some emerging market economies),',\n",

In other words, while the capacity to innovate and \\nstrengthen regulatory frameworks for digital businesses is crucial in attracting (digital) investments in low-\\nincome countries, these frameworks will be less effective without strong AI infrastructure and a digitally skilled \\nlabor force. In some emerging market economies and low-income countries where foundational preparedness \\nis not a strong binding constraint, improvement in innovation and regulatory frameworks could catalyze private \\ninvestment in digital innovations. The correlations reported in Figure 13 (panels 1 and 2) corroborate these \\narguments, with digital Infrastructure and human capital strongly associated with the digital sector size in low-\\nincome countries. With such investments, AI has the potential to improve the delivery of fundamental services \\nsuch as education and health care and could perform complex tasks in areas where skilled labor is scarce. \\nHowever, considering the costs associated with such investments and the limited fiscal space in many low-\\nincome countries, it would be prudent to focus spending on high-return projects. \\n \\nVI. Conclusions and Policy Considerations \\nAI adoption may generate labor market shifts with significant cross-country differences. The exact \\nimplications of AI for economies and societies are challenging to predict, embodying a level of uncertainty \\nreminiscent of past introductions of general-purpose technologies, such as electricity. This uncertainty is \\nparticularly pronounced in labor markets, where AI offers productivity gains but also poses risks of job \\ndisplacements. This note’s findings highlight the significant portion of global employment that is exposed to AI, \\nwith advanced economies generally both more exposed but also better positioned to leverage this technology \\nthan most emerging market and developing economies. This dynamic suggests a potential widening of the \\ndigital divide and global income disparity.  \\n \\nWomen and highly educated workers are consistently more exposed to, but also more likely to benefit \\nfrom, AI; older workers may be more likely to struggle during this technological transition. Both women, \\nwith their strong presence in the services sector, and highly educated workers, typically employed in cognitive-\\nintensive occupations, face greater AI exposure. Yet both groups also stand to gain the most from its \\nintegration. College-educated and younger people move more easily into high-complementarity jobs; older \\nworkers, however, face challenges in reemployment and adapting to new technologies, mobility, and acquiring \\nnew job skills. \\nBeyond its impact on income levels, which could increase for most workers, AI will also reshape wealth \\nand income distribution. Capital deepening and the surge in productivity driven by AI hold the potential to \\nelevate wage incomes for a broad range of workers and to increase total income. This is more likely if AI \\nexhibits significant complementarity with human labor in several roles and if the productivity boost is sufficiently \\nstrong. The enhanced economic activity and labor demand spurred by AI could offset the negative \\nconsequences of labor displacement. Unlike previous automation waves, which affected mostly middle-skilled \\nworkers, AI's displacement risks span the entire income spectrum, including high-income earners and skilled \\nprofessionals. However, the potential for AI to complement jobs is positively correlated with income levels. As \\nsuch, the trajectory of labor income inequality hinges on how well AI complements tasks undertaken by high-\\nincome professionals. Model simulations suggest that with strong complementarity, high-wage earners might\",\n",

              " 'STAFF DISCUSSION NOTES Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work \\n \\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23 \\n \\n \\nHarnessing the advantages of AI will depend on countries’ preparedness and the ability of workers to \\nadapt to this new technology. Advanced and some emerging market economies are well positioned to \\nharness AI thanks to their high exposure and preparedness. Other emerging market economies and low-\\nincome countries may find it difficult to harness potential AI benefits given their inadequate infrastructure, their \\nworkers’ lack of skills, and the absence of institutional frameworks—putting them at risk of competitive \\ndisadvantage. Economic development stages influence preparedness priorities. Advanced and more developed \\nemerging market economies should launch adequate regulatory frameworks to optimize the benefits of \\nincreased AI use and invest in complementary innovations. Low-income countries and other emerging market \\neconomies should prioritize digital infrastructure and human capital. With such investments, AI could help \\nalleviate skill shortages, expand the provision of health care and education, and improve productivity and \\ncompetitiveness in new sectors.   \\n \\nThe potential implications of AI demand a proactive approach from policymakers geared toward \\nmaintaining social cohesion. While long-term productivity gains from AI are likely, during the transition, job \\ndisplacement and changes in income distribution could have substantial political economy implications. History \\nshows that economic pressures can lead to social unrest and demands for political change. Ensuring social \\ncohesion is paramount. Policies must promote the equitable and ethical integration of AI and train the next \\ngeneration of workers in these new technologies; they must also protect and help retrain workers currently at \\nrisk from disruptions. The cross-border nature of AI amplifies its ethical and data security challenges and calls \\nfor international cooperation to ensure responsible use, as recently laid out in the Bletchley Declaration, signed \\nby 28 countries and the EU. Countries have varying capacity to address these issues, which highlights the \\nneed for harmonized global principles and local legislation.',\n",
              " 'STAFF DISCUSSION NOTES Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work \\n \\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 24 \\n \\nBox 1. Artificial Intelligence Occupational Exposure and Potential \\nComplementarity  \\n \\nSeveral studies have proposed definitions of AI exposure at the occupational level. The most common \\nis the AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) index of Felten, Raj, and Seamans (2021), measuring the \\ncorrespondence between 10 AI applications and 52 human skills. This overlap between AI and human \\nabilities is then weighted by the degree of importance and complexity of such skills in each job. This index is \\ninterpreted in relative terms and reported as normalized or rescaled between 0 and 1. It is also agnostic \\nabout the implication of exposure for human labor. In other words, it focuses on the relative likelihood of AI’s \\nintegration into the functions of a given job, but it does not consider the likelihood of AI serving as a \\ncomplementary technology or subsituting for human labor.  \\n \\nSome studies build on the AIOE measure to attempt to answer this question. Pizzinelli and others \\n(2023) propose a potential complementarity index to adjust the original AIOE measure. In this \\napproach, greater potential complementarity reduces exposure. Hence, a higher complementarity-adjusted \\nAIOE (C-AIOE) more explicitly reflects a higher chance of labor substitution. To develop this index, the \\nauthors use O*NET, the same repository of occupational characterisitcs employed by Felten, Raj, and \\nSeamans (2021), but draw from two different areas: work contexts and skills. Work contexts include social \\nand physical aspects of how work in a given occupation is carried out. Using case-by-case judgment, the \\nauthors argue that in some contexts societies may be less likely to allow unsupervised use of AI. For \\ninstance, the criticality of decisions and the gravity of the consequences of errors are two job aspects that \\nmay motivate societies to require humans to make final decisions or take actions. Judges and doctors, for \\nexample, despite high AI exposure, would still likely be human beings. \\n \\nConceptually, exposure and complementarity can be \\nthought of as two dimensions of relevance, as in Box \\nFigure 1.1.  At the first stage, exposure (x-axis) defines the \\nscope for applying AI to carry out the main functions of a job. At \\nthe second stage, given the degree of potential application, a \\nset of societal and technical concerns determines \\ncomplementarity. For occupations with high exposure, low \\ncomplementarity entails a relatively higher likelihood of AI \\nreplacing key tasks. In more acute cases, AI may lead to a \\ndecrease in the demand for the occupation altogether. This \\nwould in turn translate into reduced employment prospects, \\nlower wages, and higher risk of displacment. High exposure \\ncombined with high complementarity entails a greater likelihood \\nof workers in those jobs experiencing productivity growth and \\nwage gains from adopting AI-driven technologies. However, \\nthese benefits will likely be contingent on possessing the skills \\nneeded to use AI. Without such skills, workers may be at a \\ndisadvantage and may experience lower compensation and reduced employment prospects. Last, at lower \\nlevels of exposure, complementarity becomes less relevant, because the tasks in an occupation that are \\nlikely to be either supported or replaced by AI are less integral components of the job itself (see Annex 2 for \\nadditional details).  \\nThis box was prepared by Carlo Pizzinelli. \\nBox Figure 1.1.

Artificial-Intelligence-Led Innovation and the Potential for Greater \\nInclusion \\n \\nGrowing AI adoption has the potential to exacerbate cross-country and within-country inequality. \\nThis box argues, however, that there are also several avenues through which AI could be leveraged to foster \\ninclusion in developing economies. Enhancing inclusion in the delivery of public services that focus on \\nboosting human capital, such as health care and education, as well as in agriculture and credit access, \\npresents a promising avenue through which AI can augment productivity. \\n \\nOne example is the transformative role of digitalization in government technology (\"govtech\"). \\nHistorically, digitalization has helped modernize public finance by enhancing revenue collection and \\nspending efficiency. It has also improved the delivery of social services, thereby fostering inclusion and \\nreducing inequality (Amaglobeli and others 2023). Notably, during COVID-19–related lockdowns, nations \\nsuch as Namibia, Peru, Zambia, and Uganda successfully used their digital infrastructure to expedite the \\ndistribution of financial aid. AI could amplify this wave of transformation by assisting in informed decision-\\nmaking, identifying service gaps, detecting fraud and corruption, and customizing local interventions.  \\n \\nBy streamlining bureaucratic tasks, AI tools could also free up time and resources, which could be \\nbetter allocated to key sectors for inclusion—for example, agriculture, health care, and education. \\nInterventions in these sectors benefit primarily the socially and economically vulnerable. In agriculture, AI \\ncould be leveraged to predict yields, optimize irrigation, and identify potential pests, thereby enhancing food \\nsecurity and productivity (IFC 2020). In health care, AI could assist in predictive analytics to foresee \\noutbreaks, optimize resource allocation in hospitals, facilitate diagnoses, and make quality health care \\naccessible and affordable even in areas with shortages of qualified medical staff (Wahl and others 2018; \\nUSAID 2019). In education, personalized learning experiences could be delivered through AI algorithms, \\nreducing the human capital divide in regions lacking qualified educators (UNESCO 2021).  \\n \\nAI also holds the promise of advancing financial inclusion, specifically by using unconventional data \\nto evaluate creditworthiness (IFC 2020). This would allow underserved communities to gain access to \\nfinancial services that would otherwise be out of reach. Given the risks associated with AI technologies—\\nsuch as potential embedded bias and opaque outcomes (Shabsigh and Boukherouaa 2023)—their \\ndeployment should be accompanied by stronger frameworks for monitoring and oversight (Boukherouaa and \\nothers 2021; FCA 2022). The expansion of digital financial services has historically been linked with \\nincreased inclusion. An IMF study (Sahay and Čihák 2020) analyzed 52 emerging market and developing \\neconomies and underscored a marked rise in digital financial inclusion, with notable progress in Africa and \\nAsia. COVID-19 further accelerated the growth of digital financial services, which tend to benefit low-income \\nhouseholds and small businesses while promoting economic growth and reducing inequality (Sahay and \\nothers 2017; Sahay and Čihák 2020).  \\n \\nWhile AI adoption promises transformative change, its successful implementation requires substantial \\ninvestment, political commitment, and safeguards for data security and privacy. \\n \\nThis box was prepared by Giovanni Melina.',\n",

As is evident, some \\noccupational groups are, on average, characterized both by high exposure and high complementarity, such as \\nprofessionals, managers, and technicians. Others have both high exposure and low complementarity, such as \\nclerical workers. Another important observation is that, in general, compared with exposure, the dispersion of \\npotential complementarity is larger within than across occupational groups, suggesting that the factors that may \\ndetermine complementarity are cut across the spectrum of jobs.  \\n \\nGiven potential complementarity, θ, a complementarity-adjusted AI occupational exposure (C-AIOE) measure \\ncan be constructed as follows: C-AIOE = AIOE *(1– θ – θMIN)).

Methodology for the Worker Transition \\nAnalysis \\nIII.1 Data \\nTo analyze worker reallocation between occupations in Section III, this note uses the panel structure of the UK \\nLabor Force Survey (LFS) and Brazil’s Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios Contínua (PNADC, \\nNational Continuous Household Sampling Survey). Both surveys have a similar design: households are \\ninterviewed quarterly, and they remain in the sample for five quarters (rolling replacement survey).  \\nAlthough the PNADC survey identifies households across quarters, it does not identify the number of people \\nwithin households. Thus, a matching algorithm must be used to identify individuals across quarters based on \\nindividual characteristics. The note uses the algorithm proposed by Ribas and Soares (2008) and implemented \\nby Datazoom. \\nIII.2 Constructing Worker Flows \\nUsing the panel data, it is possible to estimate the employment flows and construct the transition matrices \\nshown in Annex Table 3.1. A transition from unemployment to inactivity (U2N), for example, is defined as \\nhappening when a worker is inactive in the current quarter but was unemployed in the previous quarter. \\nSimilarly, a transition from high-exposure employment to low-exposure employment (HE2LE) is defined as \\nhappening when a worker is employed in an occupation code with exposure above the median in the current \\nquarter but was employed in an occupation code with exposure below the median in the previous quarter. \\nAn occupational switch, or transition, is defined as happening when a worker reports an occupation code in the \\nquarter that differs from the occupation code reported in the previous quarter. This includes both job-to-job \\ntransitions (when the worker changes employer) and on-the-job transitions (when the worker switches \\noccupations but remains with the same employer). \\nIII.3 Wage Dynamics \\nThe UK LFS reports wage data only in the first and final waves of a household’s participation in the survey. \\nThus, for the analysis shown in Figure 7, the note considers transitions and wage changes over a period of one \\nyear instead of one quarter. Even though for Brazil wage data are available for all five waves a household \\nparticipates in the survey, transitions are still considered over a year so as to keep the methodology consistent \\nwith that used for the UK. \\nThe wage variation is constructed as the variation in the log gross hourly wages between the fifth and first \\nquarters an individual is in the survey. The following regression specification is run for both countries: \\n \\n𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛿𝛿1𝐽𝐽2𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿2𝐽𝐽2𝐽𝐽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 × 𝑂𝑂𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿3𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 \\n+ �𝜃𝜃𝑘𝑘\\n\\u2008\\n𝑘𝑘\\n𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖−1)\\n𝑘𝑘 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖\\n𝑘𝑘 + ��𝜙𝜙𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘\\n\\u2008\\n𝑘𝑘\\n\\u2008\\n𝑘𝑘\\n𝑂𝑂𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑖𝑖−1)\\n𝑘𝑘 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖\\n𝑘𝑘 𝑗𝑗  \\n+𝛽𝛽𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖. \\n \\nHere, i refers to the individual in the survey, t is the quarter, and r the geographic region, such that 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖 is a year-\\nquarter fixed effect and 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖 a region fixed effect.

Growth in high-exposure, high-\\ncomplementarity occupations will likely be in the formal sector, as these roles mostly require skilled, formally \\nemployed workers. Hence, AI’s growth will not necessarily move workers from the informal to the formal sector. \\nHowever, workers displaced from high-exposure, low-complementarity occupations may face job loss and \\nmove to informality. Evidence from Brazil, however, indicates a limited risk of such a double blow (Annex \\nFigure 3.1). A large share of employment in low-exposure occupations is in formal work arrangements (panel \\n1)—though this finding may not necessarily extend to other emerging market economies. Moreover, most \\noccupational switches of formal workers have not involved movement into the informal sector (panel 2).',\n",

Model Details \\nThis annex gives a brief overview of the model’s main elements and considers two extreme scenarios that \\nillustrate the main channels through which AI adoption affects the economy. The model details are in a paper \\nby Rockall, Pizzinelli, and Tavares (forthcoming), which combines the models of Drozd, Taschereau-\\nDumouchel, and Tavares (2023) and Moll, Rachel, and Restrepo (2022).  \\nIV.1 Main Model Features \\n \\nTime in the model is viewed as continuous. The final consumption good is produced using intermediate goods \\nobtained using a continuum of tasks aggregated according to a Cobb-Douglas production function. Tasks can \\nbe produced using labor or capital. Agents are heterogeneous in their skills and ability to invest in capital \\nmarkets, leading to variations in their capital endowments. Agents supply labor inelastically across different \\nsectors and are subject to dissipation shocks. Different sectors pay different wages, and agents who invest in \\nbonds receive the risk-free rate, whereas those who invest in capital markets receive a higher rate equal to the \\nreturn on capital. Agents maximize standard preferences over utility flows from consumption subject to a \\nbudget constraint and a natural debt limit. The heterogeneity in skill types and investment allows the model to \\nreplicate income and wealth inequality. \\n \\nIn the model, there are three main channels through which AI adoption affects the economy. First, labor \\ndisplacement arises because tasks performed by labor are carried out by capital, given that technological \\nprogress makes it feasible for AI to perform those tasks. It is assumed that capital is more productive than labor \\nat performing those tasks, making labor displacement productivity-enhancing. Second, complementarity \\nreallocates value added, and hence labor demand and income, from workers with less AI complementarity to \\nworkers with high AI complementarity. It is assumed that the complementarity channel does not affect the \\noverall labor share in the economy. Third, the productivity channel increases the output and wages of workers \\nwith high AI complementarity. \\n \\nThe model’s Cobb-Douglas production function is as follows: \\n \\nin which 𝜂𝜂𝑧𝑧 denotes the importance in value added of the tasks that can be performed by skill z, 𝜓𝜓𝑧𝑧 denotes the \\nproductivity of labor for these tasks, and K denotes the aggregate stock of capital in the economy. In this \\nmodel, the displacement channel is characterized by changes in 𝛼𝛼𝑧𝑧, the complementarity channel by changes \\nin 𝜂𝜂𝑧𝑧, and the productivity channel by changes in 𝜓𝜓𝑧𝑧.  \\n \\nIV.2 Additional Scenarios \\n \\nTwo hypothetical scenarios are reported to highlight the impact of the displacement and the complementarity \\nchannels. In the first scenario, the displacement effect affects all workers equally, while complementarity affects \\nworkers according to the data shown in Figure 9, panel 2. In the second scenario, the complementarity channel \\nis deactivated, and displacement occurs according to the data reported in Figure 9, panel 2.',\n",
              " 'STAFF DISCUSSION NOTES Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work \\n \\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 33 \\n \\n \\nWhen the displacement effect affects all workers equally (Annex Figure 4.1, panel 1), all workers suffer a loss \\nof labor income because they experience a decline in the number of tasks they perform. However, workers with \\nhigh AI complementarity experience an increase in the demand for tasks that were not displaced at the \\nexpense of workers with low AI complementarity. The combination of these two effects causes workers with \\nhigh AI complementarity (who are also high-income workers, as in the data) to accrue most of the gains in \\nproductivity generated by AI adoption. Consequently, AI adoption leads to more significant labor income and \\nwealth inequality under this scenario. \\n \\nIn contrast, when the AI exposure impact increases with income and there is no complementarity (Annex \\nFigure 4.1, panel 2), the income gains from adopting AI are higher at the bottom of the income distribution. This \\nhappens because workers at the bottom of the income distribution are less exposed to AI and thus suffer less \\ntask displacement. In contrast, higher-income workers are more exposed and consequently suffer greater task \\ndisplacement. As a result, under this scenario, AI adoption leads to lower income inequality since the gains in \\ncapital income are not enough to compensate for the lower gains in labor income at the top caused by task \\ndisplacement. \\n \\nThese two scenarios illustrate the importance of how exposure and complementarity are spread across the \\nincome distribution. When exposure is more equally distributed and complementarity is concentrated at the top, \\nAI adoption may raise income and wealth inequality. When exposure is concentrated at the top of the income \\ndistribution, and complementarity is weak, AI adoption could lead to a decline in income inequality. \\n \\n \\n \\nAnnex Figure 4.1.

For all scenarios, the calibrated change in the capital share is the same: 5.5 percentage points, in line with \\nthe change in the capital share observed in 1980–2014. The plots show the change in total income by income percentile, decomposed into the change \\nin labor income in blue and the change in capital income in orange. P = percentile.',\n",

AI Preparedness Index \\nV.1 Indicators \\nOne of the main contributions of this note is the construction of an index—underpinning the analysis in Section \\nV—that assesses the level of AI \\npreparedness across countries. \\nMeasuring AI preparedness is \\nchallenging, including because the \\ninstitutional requirements for economy-\\nwide integration of AI are still uncertain. \\nHowever, the literature on historical \\nepisodes of technology adoption (see \\nKeller 2004; Chinn and Fairlie 2007; \\nNicoletti, Rueden, and Andrews 2020; \\nCirera, Comin, and Cruz 2022) has identified \\nkey determinants that are likely relevant \\nfor AI: digital infrastructure, human \\ncapital, technological innovation, and \\nlegal frameworks. These broad \\ndeterminants are supplemented with a \\nset of indicators expected to be important \\nfor smooth AI adoption. These include \\nsustained human capital investment, \\ninclusive STEM [science, technology, \\nengineering, and mathematics] expertise, \\nlabor and capital mobility within and \\nacross countries, and adaptability of legal \\nframeworks to new (digital) business \\nmodels. The full set of indicators is \\nsummarized in Annex Table 5.1.  \\n \\nThe resulting index improves on common AI readiness indicators in the literature (for example, Oxford Insights \\n2022) on at least two fronts. First, the focus is on AI adoption preparedness (rather than invention leadership), \\nallowing comparability of the level of preparedness across all economies, including low-income countries \\n(where the focus will be more on adopting than inventing new technologies). Second, the index also crucially \\nincorporates labor market transition indicators relevant for the AI era, including active labor market (for \\nexample, upskilling and skills training) and social protection. Digital infrastructure and human capital and labor \\nmarket policies can be considered \"foundational” elements of AI preparedness, because they are prerequisites \\nfor its adoption. Innovation and economic integration and regulation and ethics can be considered “second-\\ngeneration” elements likely to maximize the economic impact of AI. \\nAnnex Table 5.1.

              " 'STAFF DISCUSSION NOTES Gen-AI: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work \\n \\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 35 \\n \\nV.2 Aggregation and Robustness Checks  \\nWithin each of the four aggregate dimensions, the subindicators (𝑥𝑥)—for the latest year with available data—\\nare normalized on a 0–1 scale as follows: \\n  \\n𝑥𝑥 −𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚\\n𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 −𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑚𝑚\\n \\n \\n \\nEach aggregate dimension (digital infrastructure, \\nhuman capital and labor market policies,  \\ndigital innovation and economic integration, \\nregulation and ethics) is the simple average of its \\nnormalized subcomponents. The AI Preparedness \\nIndex is then derived as the simple average of the \\nfour aggregate dimensions. The index is computed \\nfor 32 advanced economies, 56 emerging market \\neconomies, and 37 low-income countries. Annex \\nFigure 5.1 summarizes the level of AI \\npreparedness and its main components for \\nselected economies.  \\n \\nSection V shows that the index’s components are \\ncorrelated with information and communications \\ntechnology employment, corroborating their \\nrelevance. In addition, the strength of these \\ncorrelations conditional on development levels \\nmakes intuitive sense. \\n \\nEmploying simple averages in aggregating the \\nindex has at least two shortcomings.20 First, the \\nequal weighting inherently risks undervaluing key \\ncomponents and overemphasizing minor ones, \\nobscuring vital weaknesses or strengths, by \\nspreading their impact across the aggregate index. Second, the use of simple averages is sensitive to outliers \\nand extreme values.  \\n \\nAs a robustness check, we employ principal component analysis (PCA) in aggregating the index.  For each \\naggregate dimension, the first principal component (PC) of subindicators is extracted, normalized between 0 \\nand 1, and the index is then computed as the sum of these normalized PCs. The results based on the PCA are \\nindistinguishable from those obtained with simple averaging. \\n    \\n20 Other aggregation methods have their own strengths, but they also come with drawbacks in this context. For example, a constant \\nelasticity of substitution (CES) aggregation, which would assume imperfect substitutability among the index’s components, could \\nsuggest that a deficit in regulatory frameworks could be imperfectly substituted by, say, strong performance in innovation.  \\nAnnex Figure 5.1.

            "Okay, let's break down what the provided documents say about worker reallocation in the AI-induced transformation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Concepts**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **AI Exposure:** The degree to which a job's tasks can be automated or augmented by AI.\n",
            "*   **AI Complementarity:** The degree to which a job's tasks work well alongside AI, where human skills are still valuable and enhanced by AI.\n",
            "*   **Worker Reallocation:** The movement of workers between different occupations or sectors in response to changes in the labor market.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Main Points from the Documents**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Adaptation is Necessary:** The documents emphasize that the labor market will change due to AI. Workers will need to adapt to shifting skill demands and sector shifts. Some will transition to roles that are complementary to AI, while others may struggle.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Static vs. Dynamic View:** The initial analysis provides a \"static picture\" of AI exposure based on the current job landscape. However, the document stresses that this is not the end of the story. Workers will likely adapt over time, leading to a more dynamic labor market.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Jobs vs. Workers:** It's crucial to distinguish between jobs and workers. AI may eliminate some jobs and create or enhance others.  However, it's not guaranteed that the workers who lose their jobs will be the ones to benefit from new opportunities.  Worker characteristics (like skills and education) will affect adaptability.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Historical Patterns:** The documents use historical data from Brazil and the UK to analyze worker transitions across occupations with different levels of AI exposure and complementarity. This helps understand how workers have adapted to past technological changes and how they might adapt to AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Transition Outcomes:**\n",
            "    *   **High-Exposure, High-Complementarity:** Workers who transition into these roles tend to experience wage premiums. This suggests that these are valuable, well-compensated roles in the age of AI.\n",
            "    *   **Low-Exposure Roles:** Switching to jobs with low AI exposure may lead to decreased wages.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Labor Market Inflexibility:** The documents note that workers often return to similar roles after unemployment, indicating some inflexibility in the labor market. This suggests that not all workers can easily transition to new roles, and that the labor market may not be fully adjusting to changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "7.  **Education and Age:** Worker adaptation will vary based on education and age. Young, college-educated workers may be the most vulnerable to changes, but they also tend to be the most adaptable.\n",
            "\n",
            "8.  **Uncertainty:** The document acknowledges that the long-term structural transformation caused by AI is still uncertain. It's difficult to predict exactly how the labor market and individual workers will adjust to these changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "**In Summary**\n",
            "\n",
            "The documents paint a picture of a labor market in flux due to AI. Here are the key takeaways about worker reallocation:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   AI will cause shifts in the labor market, requiring workers to adapt.\n",
            "*   Workers will need to move to jobs with high AI complementarity to maintain or increase their wages.\n",
            "*   Adaptability will depend on worker characteristics like education and age.\n",
            "*   The labor market may not be fully flexible, with some workers struggling to find new roles.\n",
            "*   The long-term impact of AI on worker reallocation is still uncertain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Essentially, the documents suggest that workers need to be proactive and acquire skills that complement AI to thrive in the future job market. They also highlight the need for policies and programs that support worker transitions and address potential inequalities.\n",
